# Epic 2 Retrospective: Property Data Acquisition

**Date:** 2025-12-05
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**Participant:** Andrew (Project Lead)
**Epic Status:** COMPLETE (7/7 stories)

---

## Executive Summary

Epic 2 delivered the complete property data acquisition layer with all 7 stories completed, 182+ tests, and 5 extractors built. The retrospective identified significant wins in content-addressed storage architecture and parallel API development, while surfacing critical insights about live testing requirements and agent orchestration patterns.

**Key Outcome:** Live extraction validation required before Epic 3; orchestration metadata to be added to story/epic templates.

## What Went Well

### Wins

| Category | Finding | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Content-Addressed Storage** | E2.S4 delivered production-grade manifest system with lineage tracking | HIGH |
| **APIClient Base Class** | E2.S7 enabled rapid parallel development of 3 API integrations | HIGH |
| **Live Testing Approach** | Discovered real-world issues (BLOCK-001/002) that mocks missed | HIGH |
| **Bug Fix Discipline** | 9 critical bugs fixed proactively in E2.S4 rather than shipping fragile code | HIGH |
| **User-Agent Rotation** | 24 signatures across Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge | MEDIUM |

### Key Success Factors

1. **Parallel API Track**: E2.S5, S6, S7 executed concurrently, producing 72 tests
2. **Fallback Architecture**: nodriver → curl-cffi → Playwright MCP chain provides resilience
3. **Emergent Complexity Handled Well**: E2.S4 scope grew but team responded with quality fixes

## What Could Be Improved

### Challenges Identified

| Category | Challenge | Root Cause |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Anti-Bot Detection** | 67% Zillow extraction failure rate | PerimeterX CAPTCHA updates |
| **Mock Testing Gap** | BLOCK-001/002 only discovered in live testing | Over-reliance on mocks |
| **Orchestration Undocumented** | Parallel execution decisions not captured in stories | No template field |
| **Emergent Complexity** | E2.S4 grew from simple caching to 9 bug fixes | Original design assumptions insufficient |

### Blockers Discovered

| ID | Severity | Issue | Status |
|----|----------|-------|--------|
| BLOCK-001 | Critical | Zillow CAPTCHA (PerimeterX px-captcha) | Pending validation |
| BLOCK-002 | High | Redfin CDN 404 (session-bound URLs) | Pending validation |

## Key Lessons Learned

| # | Lesson | Category | Action |
|---|--------|----------|--------|
| L1 | Live testing is essential - mocks create false confidence | Process | Require live validation in all stories |
| L2 | Emergent complexity is normal - respond well to it | Mindset | Accept discovery, fix proactively |
| L3 | Orchestration patterns need documentation per-story and per-epic | Process | Add template fields |
| L4 | Validate before assuming - check blocker status before planning remediation | Process | Evidence-based planning |

## Epic 3 Preparation

| P1 | Run live extraction validation (5 properties) | Dev Team | 1 hr | Results documented |
| P2 | Update blocker status in sprint-status.yaml | Dev Team | 0.5 hr | Accurate status |
| P3 | Add orchestration wave plan to Epic 3 file | SM | 2 hr | Waves 1-3 defined |

### Proposed Epic 3 Orchestration

  - E3.S1: HARD Kill-Switch Criteria
  - Model: Sonnet
  - Dependencies: E1.S1, E2 data sources

Wave 2: EXTENSIONS [Parallel]
  - E3.S2: SOFT Severity System | Model: Sonnet
  - E3.S3: Verdict Evaluation | Model: Sonnet
  - Conflicts: None

Wave 3: PRESENTATION [Parallel]
  - E3.S4: Failure Explanations | Model: Haiku

## ADDENDUM: Course Correction (2025-12-06)

**Status:** BLOCKERS RESOLVED via Multi-Wave Remediation

### What Happened

Live testing revealed image extraction pipeline had critical architectural bugs preventing disk persistence and metadata extraction. Rather than simple CAPTCHA bypass, the issue required comprehensive remediation.

### Three-Wave Remediation Summary

| Wave | Focus | Commits | Impact |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Wave 1** | Error handling & schema versioning | 74d91f5 | Retry decorator, state v2.0.0, transient error classification |
| **Wave 2** | ImageProcessor wiring | 0b4fa88, 3697b0c | Fixed extractor creation bug → 31+ images now saving to disk |
| **Wave 3** | Metadata persistence | 02041da | Kill-switch auto-persist to enrichment_data.json |

**Integration Testing:** 67 new tests created (commit 3880460), all passing

### Results Achieved

**Test Property:** 4560 E Sunrise Dr, Phoenix, AZ 85044

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Images Extracted | 31 (content-addressed PNG) |
| Sources Used | PhoenixMLS, Zillow ZPID |
| Kill-Switch Fields | 8/8 (100%) ✅ |
| Metadata Persisted | Yes ✅ |
| Blockers Resolved | BLOCK-001 (resolved), BLOCK-002 (mitigated) |

### Gap Analysis (Post-Wave 3)

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Kill-Switch Fields | 8/8 (100%) ✅ |
| Scoring Fields | 0/22 (0%) - Requires Epic 6 |
| Deal Analysis Fields | 0/25 (0%) - Requires Epic 7 |

### Updated Action Item Status

| # | Action | Original Status | Updated Status (2025-12-06) |
|---|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| A4 | Run live extraction validation | CRITICAL | ✅ COMPLETE |
| A5 | Remediate BLOCK-001 | HIGH | ✅ RESOLVED (Waves 1-3) |
| A6 | Remediate BLOCK-002 | HIGH | ✅ MITIGATED (sufficient coverage) |
| A7 | Update sprint-status.yaml | HIGH | ✅ COMPLETE |

### Key Learnings from Course Correction

| # | Lesson | Impact |
|---|--------|--------|
| L5 | Root cause analysis revealed architectural bugs, not just CAPTCHA issues | Critical |
| L6 | Multi-wave remediation pattern effective for complex issues | High |
| L7 | Integration testing (67 tests) validates architectural fixes | High |
| L8 | Gap analysis shows 100% kill-switch coverage enables Epic 3 | High |

### Epic 3 Readiness Update
