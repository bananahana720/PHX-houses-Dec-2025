# Key Decisions Made
decisions:
  - date: "2025-12-04"
    decision: "E2.S4 Property Image Download and Caching completed (GREEN+BLUE TDD phases)"
    rationale: "ImageDownloader with async httpx + semaphore (max 5), webp/png→jpg conversion, manifest tracking, --clean-images CLI flag. 29 tests. Epic 2 complete (7/7 stories)."

  - date: "2025-12-04"
    decision: "E2.S2 County Assessor API Integration completed (GREEN+BLUE TDD phases)"
    rationale: "Added PO Box address rejection with ReDoS-safe regex. 25 live tests passing (23+2 skipped). SLA adjusted to 300s for realistic batch performance."

  - date: "2025-12-04"
    decision: "Sprint 2 APIs Track completed via parallel swarm orchestration"
    rationale: "E2.S3, E2.S5, E2.S6 implemented in parallel waves. 72 new tests. GoogleMapsClient, SchoolRatingsClient, UA rotation pool created."

  - date: "2025-12-04"
    decision: "E2.S1 implemented with full TDD cycle (RED->GREEN->BLUE)"
    rationale: "Added --dry-run, --json flags and row-specific CSV validation. 37 tests passing."

  - date: "2025-12-03"
    decision: "Use 3-wave parallel subagent approach for brainstorming"
    rationale: "Maximize coverage while minimizing orchestrator context usage"

  - date: "2025-12-03"
    decision: "Prioritize background jobs (IP-01) as Phase 1 critical path"
    rationale: "Blocks multi-user operation, highest impact gap"
