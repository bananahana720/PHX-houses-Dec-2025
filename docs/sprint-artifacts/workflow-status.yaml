# Key Decisions Made
decisions:
  - date: "2025-12-03"
    decision: "Use 3-wave parallel subagent approach for brainstorming"
    rationale: "Maximize coverage while minimizing orchestrator context usage"

  - date: "2025-12-03"
    decision: "Prioritize background jobs (IP-01) as Phase 1 critical path"
    rationale: "Blocks multi-user operation, highest impact gap"
