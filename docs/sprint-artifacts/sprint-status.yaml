# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#   - done: Epic completed
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Under SM review (via code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'

    resolution: "Multi-wave remediation completed (E2.R1 base + Wave 1-3)"
    title: "Zillow CAPTCHA blocking all extractions"
    description: |
      Fresh extraction validation on 3 test properties revealed PerimeterX
      CAPTCHA blocking 100% of Zillow requests. px-captcha element detected.
      CAPTCHA solve attempts failed ("could not find CAPTCHA button").

      RESOLUTION (2025-12-06): Three-wave remediation completed:
      - Wave 1: Retry decorator + schema v2.0.0 + error classification (74d91f5)
      - Wave 2: ImageProcessor wiring fixes, 31+ images now saving (0b4fa88, 3697b0c)
      - Wave 3: MetadataPersister + kill-switch auto-persist (02041da)

      E2.R1 pivoted to PhoenixMLS as PRIMARY data source with 95%+ reliability
      and no anti-bot systems. Zillow moved to fallback. PhoenixMLS extracts
      all 8 kill-switch fields + 23 MLS metadata fields. 67 integration tests
      created and passing (commit 3880460). Gap analysis shows 8/8 kill-switch
      fields now complete.
    affected: "E2.S3, E2.S4 - Image extraction pipeline"

    title: "Redfin CDN returning 404 for image URLs"
    description: |
      Redfin image URLs discovered but downloads fail with HTTP 404.
      Pattern: https://ssl.cdn-redfin.com/photo/86/bcsphoto/*.jpg → 404
      URLs may be session-bound or time-limited.

      MITIGATION (2025-12-07): With PhoenixMLS PRIMARY + Zillow ZPID fallback,
      image coverage is sufficient (31+ images from test property). Original
      E2.R2 "Redfin Session-Bound Download" story replaced with "PhoenixMLS Full
      Listing Attribute Extraction" to expand from 10 kill-switch fields to 47+
      comprehensive listing attributes (22 HIGH scoring + 25 MEDIUM deal analysis).
