# Conclusion

The PHX Houses pipeline demonstrates **strong data engineering fundamentals** with excellent lineage tracking, atomic operations, and comprehensive validation. However, **critical gaps in schema evolution and ETL orchestration** limit production readiness.

**Key Action Items:**
1. Implement schema versioning and migrations (CRITICAL)
2. Add Prefect/Dagster orchestration (CRITICAL)
3. Enforce lineage tracking at all entry points (HIGH)
4. Add automated retention policy enforcement (HIGH)

With these improvements, the pipeline would achieve **A-grade production readiness**.
