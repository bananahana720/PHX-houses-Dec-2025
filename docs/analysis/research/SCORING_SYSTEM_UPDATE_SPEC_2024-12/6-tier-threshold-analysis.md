# 6. Tier Threshold Analysis

### 6.1 Should Thresholds Change?

**Recommendation: NO CHANGE to tier thresholds**

The tier thresholds remain appropriate because:

1. **Percentage-based calibration** - Thresholds are defined as percentages of max score:
   - Unicorn: >80% (>480 of 600)
   - Contender: 60-80% (360-480)
   - Pass: <60% (<360)

2. **Total score unchanged** - The 600-point maximum is maintained

3. **Section rebalancing is minor** - Shifting 25 pts from Location to Systems doesn't fundamentally change score distribution

### 6.2 Distribution Impact Analysis

**Expected Impact:**

| Property Profile | Score Impact | Tier Impact |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| New HVAC (0-5 years) | +25 pts (full) | Potential tier upgrade |
| Aging HVAC (11-15 years) | +12 pts | Neutral |
| Old HVAC (16+ years) | +5 pts | Potential tier downgrade |
| Leased Solar + other SOFT | Kill-switch FAIL | Excluded before scoring |
| Leased Solar only | WARNING | Flagged but scored |

**Score Range Examples:**

| Scenario | Current Score | New Score | Delta |
|----------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Excellent property, new HVAC | 520 | 545 | +25 |
| Excellent property, aging HVAC | 520 | 507 | -13 |
| Average property, old HVAC | 380 | 360 | -20 |
| Borderline property, new HVAC | 355 | 380 | +25 |
