## MKT-04: Solar Lease vs. Owned Resale Impact

### Summary Comparison Table

| Factor | Leased Solar | Owned Solar |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Home Value Impact | -3% to -8% | +4.1% to +6.9% |
| Appraisal Treatment | Not included | Adds value |
| Buyer Appeal | Low (complicates sale) | High |
| Monthly Cost | $100-200+ (escalating) | $0 (after payoff) |
| Tax Credits | Leasing company keeps | Homeowner claims 30% |
| Transfer Process | Complex (credit check, fees) | Simple (ownership transfers) |

**[High Confidence]** - Multiple sources confirm significant value differential.

### 1. Impact on Home Resale Value

**Leased Solar Value Impact [High Confidence]:**

According to Mike Orr with W.P. Carey School of Arizona State University (ASU), analysis of Phoenix solar home sales shows:

> "A leased solar power system can detract 3 to 8 percent from the value of a metro Phoenix home."

**Why Leases Reduce Value:**
- Fannie Mae: Leased panels may not be included in appraisal value
- Creates psychological hurdle for buyers
- Homes with leased solar sit on market longer
- Buyers can get their own lease on any property

**Owned Solar Value Impact [High Confidence]:**

| Study | Time Period | Value Increase |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Zillow Original | 2018-2019 | +4.1% (~$9,274) |
| Zillow Updated | 2020-2021 | +1.4% |
| SolarReviews | 2022-2024 | +6.9% (~$25,000) |

**National Average:** Owned solar adds approximately $25,000 to home value (6.9% premium).

**Arizona-Specific:**
- Tara Rutkowski (AZ real estate expert): Solar adds $1,000 - $1,500 per kW
- 6kW system = $6,000 - $9,000 value increase
- May 2024: Phoenix solar homes sold above median of $450,000

### 2. Solar Lease Transfer Process

**Transfer Requirements [High Confidence]:**

1. **Before Listing:**
   - Contact solar company to initiate UCC-1 lien removal
   - Gather lease documentation
   - Determine buyer credit requirements

2. **During Escrow:**
   - Buyer submits credit application to leasing company
   - Buyer must meet minimum credit requirements
   - Both parties sign transfer agreement
   - Title company clears/subordinates UCC-1 lien

3. **After Closing:**
   - Provide proof of ownership (title copy)
   - Solar company re-files lien in buyer's name
   - Seller released from liability (if properly documented)

**Transfer Fees:** $200 - $500 (charged by some solar companies)

**Timeline:** Can take multiple weeks; start immediately after opening escrow.

**Legal Requirements (Arizona):**
- A.R.S. Section 33-422 requires disclosure of leased solar devices
- Must provide leasing company name and phone number
- Arizona Association of REALTORS provides Solar Lease/Loan Assumption Addendum

**Deal-Breaker Risk [Medium Confidence]:**
If buyer cannot or will not assume lease, seller must either:
- Pay off entire lease (potentially $20,000+)
- Find different buyer
- Risk deal falling through

### 3. Escalator Rates (Annual Increases)

**Typical Escalator Rates [High Confidence]:**

| Company/Type | Annual Escalator | 20-Year Impact |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| Most common | 0.9% - 2.9% | Moderate - High |
| SunRun (typical) | 2.5% - 3.5% | High |
| Industry average | 1% - 5% | Varies |
| Recommended max | <3% | Stay below utility increases |

**Financial Impact Example:**
- Starting payment: $100/month
- With 2.9% escalator over 20 years:
  - Year 1: $1,200/year
  - Year 10: $1,560/year
  - Year 20: $2,033/year
  - Total paid: ~$32,000

- With 0% escalator over 20 years:
  - All years: $1,200/year
  - Total paid: $24,000

**Difference: ~$8,000 over contract term**

**Real-World Example (Forum Data):**
One homeowner calculated paying off escalator removal cost would save $4,969 over remaining term ($18,972 vs $27,572 total payments).

**Comparison to Utility Rates [Medium Confidence]:**
- Solar companies claim: 3-5% annual utility increases
- US EIA actual data: ~2% annual increase
- Recommendation: Escalator should be <2.8% (10-year average utility increase)

### 4. Buyer Objections to Solar Leases

**Primary Buyer Concerns [High Confidence]:**

1. **Long-term Contract Commitment**
   - 15-25 year lease terms
   - Inheriting contract they didn't negotiate
   - Unknown remaining obligations

2. **Credit Qualification Required**
   - Buyer must pass solar company credit check
   - May not qualify regardless of mortgage approval
   - Additional documentation burden

3. **Escalator Payment Increases**
   - Hidden in contract fine print
   - Payments grow while system ages/degrades
   - May eventually exceed utility costs

4. **No Ownership Benefits**
   - Cannot claim 30% federal tax credit
   - No equity in the system
   - System doesn't add to home value

5. **Lien Complications**
   - UCC-1 filing creates title "cloud"
   - Complicates closing process
   - Some buyers walk away over this

6. **Technology Obsolescence Risk**
   - 20-year contract on aging technology
   - Panel efficiency degrades over time
   - Cannot upgrade without lease modification

**Realtor Perspectives [Medium Confidence]:**

> "In my experience, solar has deterred more buyers than it has attracted buyers to listings with solar." - Marin County Realtor

> "Solar leases now fall in the 'likely a challenge' category when evaluating a property." - Thomas Henthorne, Marin Realtor

### 5. Owned Solar Value vs. Lease Liability

**Value Comparison [High Confidence]:**

| Ownership Type | Home Value Impact | Monthly Cost | 25-Year Savings |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Purchased (cash) | +6.9% (+$25,000) | $0 | $65,000+ |
| Financed (loan) | +4.1% (+$17,000) | Fixed payment | Varies |
| Leased | -3% to -8% | $100-200+ (escalating) | Minimal |
| PPA | -3% to -8% | Per-kWh rate | Minimal |

**Arizona Market Context:**
- 75% of Phoenix-area solar is leased (not owned)
- This creates significant inventory of lease-burdened homes
- May extend days-on-market for affected properties

**Financial Comparison (6kW System, Arizona):**

| Factor | Owned | Leased |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Upfront Cost | $15,000-20,000 | $0 |
| Federal Tax Credit (30%) | $4,500-6,000 | $0 (company keeps) |
| Net Cost | $10,500-14,000 | $0 |
| 20-Year Payments | $0 | $24,000-32,000 |
| Home Value Impact | +$17,000 | -$13,500 to -$36,000 |
| **Net Wealth Impact** | **+$17,000** | **-$37,500 to -$68,000** |

**[Medium Confidence]** - Calculations based on median Phoenix home value of $450,000 and typical system sizes.

- [Sun Valley Solar - Lease Buyout Considerations](https://www.sunvalleysolar.com/blog/should-i-buy-out-of-my-solar-lease-or-stay-in-it-to-term)

### 6. Lease Buyout Costs

**Buyout Cost Range [Medium Confidence]:**

| Scenario | Typical Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Early buyout (Years 1-5) | $15,000 - $25,000+ | Often not available |
| Mid-term (Years 5-10) | $9,000 - $21,000 | Most common range |
| Late-term (Years 15-20) | $3,000 - $10,000 | Decreases over time |
| End of term | Fair market value | Usually $0-5,000 |

**Factors Affecting Buyout:**
- Remaining term length
- Original system cost
- Company's recapture of tax credits
- "Fair market value" determination
- Contract-specific terms

**Real-World Examples:**
- 2016 lease with 8 years remaining: $9,000 buyout
- California homeowner offered $21,000 (wouldn't negotiate from contract price)
- Forum user: $6,000 with 5 years remaining

**Important Consideration [High Confidence]:**
> "Even if that value seems reasonable, providers also typically require you to pay back the value of tax credits they got for purchasing the equipment, which could easily be thousands of dollars."

## Conflicting Data & Discrepancies

### Pool Cost Variations
**Issue:** Wide range in reported costs ($80-$200/month for professional service)
**Explanation:** Variation based on pool size, service level, and provider pricing
**Recommendation:** Use mid-range estimates ($125/month service) for scoring

### Solar Value Impact Range
**Issue:** Zillow studies show +1.4% to +4.1%, while SolarReviews shows +6.9%
**Explanation:** Different methodologies and time periods
**Recommendation:** Use conservative 4.1% for owned solar value impact

### Escalator Rate Claims
**Issue:** Solar companies claim 3-5% utility rate increases; EIA shows 2%
**Explanation:** Marketing vs. historical data
**Recommendation:** Use EIA data (2%) as baseline for escalator evaluation

---

## Recommendations for PHX Houses Scoring System

### Pool Adjustments

**1. Monthly Cost Factor:**
Add $250-400/month to cost efficiency calculations for properties with pools:
- Conservative (DIY capable): $250/month
- Moderate (hybrid): $300/month
- Full service expected: $400/month

**2. Equipment Age Consideration:**
- Pool pump >8 years: Add $1,500 to near-term expenses
- Pool heater >12 years: Add $3,000 to near-term expenses
- Consider equipment age in Section B (Systems) scoring

### Solar Lease Kill-Switch

**RECOMMENDATION: Add Solar Lease as HARD KILL-SWITCH**

**Rationale [High Confidence]:**
1. 3-8% home value reduction directly impacts investment
2. 75% of Phoenix solar is leased = significant deal flow impact
3. Complicates resale (credit requirements, transfer process)
4. Escalating payments reduce cost efficiency over time
5. No appraisal value = financing complications

**Implementation:**
```
HARD Kill-Switch Criteria:
- HOA: Must be $0 (instant fail)
- Beds: Must be >= 4 (instant fail)
- Baths: Must be >= 2 (instant fail)
- Solar Lease: Must be NONE or OWNED (instant fail) [NEW]
```

**Alternative (if HARD seems too restrictive):**
Add as SOFT criterion with severity 2.5 (same as sewer):
- Combined with other soft factors would likely trigger fail anyway

### Owned Solar Bonus

**RECOMMENDATION: Add +5 points for Owned Solar**

**Rationale:**
- 4-6% value premium on resale
- Reduced monthly utility costs
- Growing buyer preference (57% of agents value energy efficiency features)

**Implementation:**
Add to Section A (Location) or Section B (Systems):
- Owned solar panels: +5 pts
- Solar lease or PPA: 0 pts (or kill-switch)
