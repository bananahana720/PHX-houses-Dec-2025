# 3. Regulatory & Domain Intelligence Summary

### Arizona-Specific Factors Confirmed/Updated

**Building System Lifespan Adjustments:**

| System | National Average | Arizona Lifespan | Reduction | Scoring Impact |
|--------|------------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|
| HVAC/AC | 15-20 years | **8-15 years** | 20-40% | Major recalibration needed |
| Asphalt Roof | 20-30 years | **12-25 years** | 17-30% | Moderate recalibration |
| Tile Roof (tiles) | 50-100 years | 50-100 years | None | No change |
| Tile Roof (underlayment) | 20-30 years | **12-20 years** | 33-40% | Add as scoring factor |
| Pool Equipment | 10-15 years | **8-12 years** | 20% | Add equipment age factor |

**Critical HVAC Insight:** A 10-year-old HVAC unit in Phoenix has done the equivalent work of a 15-year-old system in moderate climates due to 30-40% more runtime hours. The "$5,000 Rule" applies: multiply age x repair cost; if >$5,000, replace.

**HVAC Replacement Costs (2024 Phoenix):**
- Central AC only: $6,000-$12,500
- Full HVAC system: $11,000-$26,000
- High-efficiency (18+ SEER): $15,000-$26,000

- Seller must provide disclosures within 10 days
- Maximum disclosure fee: $550 total
- Civil penalty for violations: Up to $1,200
- Buyer acknowledgment required

**Solar Lease Regulations (A.R.S. Section 44-1763):**

### Infrastructure Considerations

**Water Security (Critical 2023 Update):**

The 2023 groundwater moratorium created a definitive two-tier market:

| Tier | Status | Cities | Water Security | Recommendation |
|------|--------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1: Secure** | DAWS | Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, Scottsdale, Tempe, Glendale, Peoria, Goodyear, Avondale | 100-year assured | PASS |
| **Tier 2: At Risk** | Non-DAWS | Buckeye, Queen Creek (SE), San Tan Valley (parts) | Groundwater dependent | WARNING |

**EPCOR West Valley:** Received first new DAWS designation in 25 years (October 2025), enabling 60,000 new homes.

**City of Phoenix Water Portfolio:**
- ~60% Salt/Verde Rivers
- ~40% Colorado River (CAP)
- ~2% groundwater

**Septic vs. Sewer:**

| Factor | City Sewer | Septic System |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Annual Cost | $360-720 | $400-950+ |
| Failure Risk | Minimal | **10%+** |
| Pre-sale Inspection | Not required | **Mandatory** |
| Replacement Cost | N/A | $6,000-$50,000 |
| Arizona Soil Issues | None | Caliche, clay, drainage problems |

**Recommendation:** Maintain sewer preference as SOFT kill-switch with severity 2.5.

### Foundation Considerations

**Standard Types:**
- Slab-on-Grade: Most common
- Post-Tension Slab: Common in newer homes, expansive soil areas

**Warning Signs:**
- Stair-step cracks in masonry (HIGH severity)
- Horizontal cracks in stem wall (HIGH severity)
- Sticking doors/windows (MEDIUM severity)
- Sloping floors (HIGH severity)

**Repair Costs:** $4,000-$15,000 for stabilization; $2,000-$3,000 per helical pier.
