# DOM-02: Roof Lifespan by Material Type in Arizona

### Tile Roofs (Clay and Concrete)

**[High Confidence]** Tile roofs are the most common and durable option in Phoenix:

| Tile Type | Tile Lifespan | Underlayment Lifespan | Effective Roof Life |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Clay Tile | 50-100+ years | 12-20 years | 12-20 years between R&R |
| Concrete Tile | 40-60 years | 12-20 years | 12-20 years between R&R |

**Critical Insight:** The tiles themselves last decades, but the **underlayment** is the actual waterproofing layer. In Arizona:
- Underlayment typically needs replacement every **12-20 years**
- This requires a full tile "Remove & Replace" (R&R) typically every **13-16 years**
- Summer roof temperatures exceed **160F**, causing daily expansion/contraction stress
- UV radiation breaks down felt, dries flashing, and cracks sealants

### Asphalt Shingle Roofs

**[High Confidence]** Significantly shorter lifespan in Arizona:

| Shingle Type | Arizona Lifespan | National Average | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| 3-Tab Standard | 12-15 years | 15-20 years | Budget option |
| Architectural | 15-20 years | 20-30 years | Better durability |
| Premium/Designer | 18-25 years | 25-30 years | UV-resistant options |

**Heat/UV Degradation Factors:**
- Roofs lose 20-30% of expected lifespan due to heat and solar damage alone
- Temperature extremes (chilly nights to 115F+ days) cause expansion/contraction
- UV rays break down essential oils in shingles, reducing protective capacity
- Black shingles can reach **190F** vs. **150F** for light-colored options

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Light-colored/reflective shingles reduce thermal damage
- UV-resistant coatings can extend lifespan
- Regular inspections catch early degradation

### Flat/Foam Roofs (SPF - Sprayed Polyurethane Foam)

**[Medium Confidence]** Popular for flat roof applications:

| Maintenance Level | Lifespan | Recoat Interval |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Well-maintained | 25-30+ years | 7-10 years |
| Average maintenance | 15-25 years | 5-10 years |
| Neglected | 10-15 years | N/A |

**Key Considerations:**
- UV protective coating must be reapplied every 5-10 years
- Seamless protection ideal for Arizona's monsoon rains
- Excellent insulation properties reduce cooling costs
- Particularly suited for flat commercial/residential roofs

### Underlayment Failure Patterns

**[High Confidence]** Critical information for visual assessments:

| Underlayment Type | Arizona Performance | Recommendation |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Standard felt paper | Poor - deteriorates rapidly under UV, bubbles within 24 hours of exposure | Not recommended |
| Synthetic | Poor to Medium - many roofers report degradation in dry heat | Controversial for Arizona |
| Self-adhering (e.g., Boral Tile Secure) | Best - handles 6-12 months of UV exposure | Recommended for tile |
| Double-layer 40# felt | Good - common Arizona practice | Acceptable option |
| Modified bitumen (valleys) | Best for high-stress areas | Required in valleys |

**Important Note:** Many experienced Arizona roofers do NOT recommend synthetic underlayment under tile roofs due to:
- Non-self-sealing around nail penetrations
- Faster degradation in dry heat
- Lack of proven long-term performance in Arizona

### Replacement Cost Ranges (2024)

**[High Confidence]** Phoenix-area roofing costs:

| Roof Type | Cost per Sq Ft | 2,000 Sq Ft Home | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Asphalt Shingle (3-tab) | $3.50 - $5.50 | $7,000 - $11,000 | Budget option |
| Asphalt Shingle (architectural) | $6.00 - $8.00 | $12,000 - $16,000 | Better aesthetics |
| Concrete Tile | $8 - $15 | $16,000 - $30,000 | Most common in AZ |
| Clay Tile | $10 - $18 | $20,000 - $36,000 | Premium option |
| Foam/SPF | $1.50 - $6.00 | $3,000 - $12,000 | Flat roofs |
| Metal | $7 - $18 | $14,000 - $36,000 | Long-lasting |

**Additional Costs:**
- Old roof removal: $1 - $4 per sq ft ($2,000 - $8,000)
- Labor: 50-60% of total cost
- Permits/inspections: $100 - $500
- Underlayment upgrade: $500 - $2,000

**Pro Tip:** Roofing during off-season (fall/winter) can save 10-15% on labor.
