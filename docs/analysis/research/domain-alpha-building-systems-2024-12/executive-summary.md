# Executive Summary

This research report provides comprehensive data on building system lifespans in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area for integration into the PHX Houses Analysis Pipeline scoring system. Key findings indicate that Arizona's extreme desert climate significantly reduces the lifespan of major building systems compared to national averages.

### Key Findings

| System | Arizona Lifespan | National Average | Reduction |
|--------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| HVAC/AC | 8-15 years | 15-20 years | 20-40% |
| Asphalt Shingle Roof | 12-25 years | 20-30 years | 17-30% |
| Tile Roof (tiles) | 50-100 years | 50-100 years | None |
| Tile Roof (underlayment) | 12-20 years | 20-30 years | 33-40% |
| Foam/Flat Roof | 15-30 years | 20-30 years | 0-25% |

**Critical Insight for Scoring:** The Arizona HVAC penalty is severe. A 10-year-old HVAC unit in Phoenix has done the equivalent work of a 15-year-old system in moderate climates due to 30-40% more runtime hours annually.
