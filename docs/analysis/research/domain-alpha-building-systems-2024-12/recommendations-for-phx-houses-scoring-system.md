# Recommendations for PHX Houses Scoring System

Based on this research, the following adjustments are recommended for the scoring system:

### HVAC Scoring Adjustments

**Current Assumption:** HVAC lasts 20+ years
**Recommended Adjustment:** Use 10-15 year lifespan for Arizona

| HVAC Age | Scoring Impact | Rationale |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| 0-5 years | Full points | New system, minimal concern |
| 6-10 years | Moderate deduction | Approaching mid-life in Arizona |
| 11-15 years | Significant deduction | End-of-life territory |
| 15+ years | Major deduction + cost flag | Replacement likely needed |

**Additional Factors:**
- Deduct points for unknown maintenance history
- Bonus points for documented bi-annual maintenance
- Consider brand (Trane/Carrier preferred for parts availability)

### Roof Scoring Adjustments

**For Tile Roofs:**
| Factor | Scoring Approach |
|--------|------------------|
| Tile age | Less important than underlayment |
| Underlayment age | Key factor - assume R&R needed every 15 years |
| Last R&R date | If unknown and roof >12 years, budget for R&R |
| Visible damage | Deduct for cracked/displaced tiles |

**For Shingle Roofs:**
| Age | Scoring Impact |
|-----|----------------|
| 0-8 years | Full points |
| 9-15 years | Moderate deduction |
| 15-20 years | Significant deduction |
| 20+ years | Major deduction, replacement imminent |

### Foundation Scoring Adjustments

| Factor | Scoring Approach |
|--------|------------------|
| Post-tension slab | Slight bonus (better crack resistance) |
| Expansive soil area | Flag for closer inspection |
| Visible cracks (stair-step/horizontal) | Major deduction |
| Sticking doors/windows | Moderate deduction, note for inspection |
| Year built pre-1990 | Consider settling risk |

### Cost Budget Recommendations

Include these replacement cost estimates in deal sheet calculations:

| System | Budget Amount | Timing Trigger |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| HVAC | $12,000 - $18,000 | Age 12+ years |
| Tile Roof R&R | $15,000 - $25,000 | Last R&R 12+ years ago |
| Shingle Roof | $10,000 - $16,000 | Age 15+ years |
| Foundation Repair | $6,000 - $15,000 | If warning signs present |
