# DOM-01: HVAC Lifespan in Phoenix

### Average Lifespan Ranges

| Source Type | Lifespan Estimate | Confidence |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| Local HVAC contractors | 8-12 years | High |
| Industry publications | 10-15 years | High |
| With proper maintenance | 12-15 years | Medium |
| Neglected systems | <10 years | High |

**[High Confidence]** The consensus from Arizona HVAC professionals is that air conditioning units last **8-15 years** in Phoenix, compared to the national average of 15-20 years. The most commonly cited range is **10-12 years** for typical residential installations.

### Impact of Extreme Heat (115F+)

**[High Confidence]** Arizona's extreme heat has multiple documented effects on HVAC systems:

1. **Runtime Penalty:** Systems in Phoenix experience 30-40% more runtime hours annually compared to moderate climates. This means a 10-year-old unit has effectively done 15 years of work.

2. **Efficiency Degradation:** Desert conditions cause approximately 2-3% annual efficiency loss compared to 1-2% in moderate climates. A 15-year-old system may operate at only 55-70% of original efficiency.

3. **Component Stress:**
   - **Compressors:** Leading cause of failure due to overheating when ambient temperatures exceed design specifications
   - **Capacitors:** Lifespan reduced from 20 years to potentially half that in extreme heat
   - **Fan Motors:** Operating at 115F ambient exceeds manufacturer specs; require quarterly bearing lubrication
   - **Ductwork:** Attic spaces reaching 150F cause accelerated deterioration and air leaks

4. **Temperature Differential:** Systems should maintain a 30-40F differential (if 100F outside, indoor temp should be ~60-70F). Settings lower than this force units to work beyond optimal operating range.

### Manufacturer Recommendations for Desert Climates

**[Medium Confidence]** Major brands have specific considerations for Arizona:

| Brand | Max SEER | Desert Notes |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Trane | 22 SEER2 | Emphasizes durability, widely available parts, tested in extreme conditions |
| Lennox | 28 SEER2 | Highest efficiency, but requires proprietary parts and specially trained technicians |
| Carrier | 24 SEER2 | Excel in efficiency and quiet operation |

**Key Recommendations:**
- Minimum 14 SEER required in Phoenix (building code)
- Higher SEER ratings (18+) recommended for desert efficiency
- Bi-annual professional maintenance critical (spring and fall)
- Quarterly filter changes during peak summer months

### Signs of HVAC Aging/Failure

**[High Confidence]** Warning signs documented by Phoenix HVAC professionals:

| Warning Sign | Severity | Action Required |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| Age 10+ years | Moderate | Plan replacement |
| Rising energy bills (>15% increase) | Moderate | Efficiency inspection |
| Frequent repairs (>2/year) | High | Consider replacement |
| Unusual noises (grinding, rattling, hissing) | High | Immediate service |
| Short cycling (frequent on/off) | High | Professional diagnosis |
| Poor cooling performance | Moderate | Service check |
| Burning odors | Critical | Shut off, emergency service |
| High humidity indoors | Moderate | System inspection |

**$5,000 Rule:** Multiply system age by repair cost. If result exceeds $5,000, replacement is more cost-effective than repair.

### Replacement Cost Ranges (2024)

**[High Confidence]** Based on Phoenix-area contractor quotes:

| System Type | Cost Range | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| Central AC only | $6,000 - $12,500 | Most common |
| Full HVAC (heat + cool) | $11,000 - $26,000 | Complete replacement |
| High-efficiency units | $15,000 - $26,000 | 18+ SEER systems |
| Budget options | $5,000 - $8,800 | Entry-level, lower SEER |

**Additional Costs:**
- Installation labor: $1,500 - $5,000
- Ductwork repair/replacement: $2,000 - $10,000
- City permits: $180 - $200
- Disposal of old unit: Included by most contractors

**Pro Tip:** Off-season installation (fall/winter) can save 10-15% on labor costs.
