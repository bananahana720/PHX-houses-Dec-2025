# Data Quality Notes

### Confidence Level Summary

| Research Area | Overall Confidence | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| HVAC Lifespan | High | Strong consensus across sources |
| HVAC Costs | High | Multiple recent contractor quotes |
| Tile Roof Lifespan | High | Well-documented in Arizona |
| Underlayment Issues | High | Critical Arizona-specific factor |
| Shingle Roof Lifespan | High | Clear data on UV/heat impact |
| Foam Roof | Medium | Some variation in sources |
| Foundation Types | High | Building code documented |
| Expansive Soil Issues | High | Well-researched topic |
| Foundation Costs | Medium | Highly variable by project |

### Conflicting Data Points

1. **HVAC Lifespan:** Ranges from 8-15 years depending on source. Conservative estimate of 10-12 years recommended for scoring.

2. **Synthetic Underlayment:** Conflicting recommendations - some sources recommend, Arizona roofers often warn against. Recommend flagging as risk factor.

3. **Foam Roof Lifespan:** Ranges from 15-30+ years. Maintenance-dependent, use 20 years as conservative estimate.

### Areas Needing Further Research

1. Home warranty claim data for Arizona (HVAC/roof failure rates)
2. Insurance industry statistics on roof claims by material type
3. Post-tension slab failure rates vs. standard slabs
4. Solar panel installation impact on roof underlayment
5. Ground water level changes affecting expansive soil behavior
