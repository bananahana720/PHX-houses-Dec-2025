# DOM-03: Arizona Foundation Inspection Standards

### Standard Foundation Types in Phoenix

**[High Confidence]** Arizona residential construction primarily uses:

| Foundation Type | Prevalence | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| Slab-on-Grade | Most Common | Concrete slab poured directly on ground |
| Post-Tension Slab | Common (newer homes) | Reinforced with tensioned steel cables |
| Standard Monolithic | Less Common | Rebar only around perimeter |

**Post-Tension Slab Details:**
- Contains horizontal grid pattern of steel reinforcement cable throughout slab
- Cables stretched to 25,000 psi with hydraulic jacks after concrete cures
- Creates a foundation that maintains shape with less cracking
- Provides flexibility important in Arizona's shifting soils
- Common in areas with expansive soil (Gilbert, Chandler, Cave Creek, parts of Scottsdale, north Phoenix)

**Note:** The majority of Phoenix homes do NOT have post-tension slabs. Builders use them primarily in high-risk expansive soil areas or when seeking to reduce warranty claims from cracked slabs.

### Common Foundation Issues in Arizona

**[High Confidence]** Expansive clay soil is the primary cause of foundation problems:

| Issue | Cause | Prevalence |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Heave | Wet soil expansion pushing foundation up | High (monsoon season) |
| Settlement | Soil contraction/consolidation | High (dry periods) |
| Cracking | Differential movement | Very High |
| Wall bowing | Lateral soil pressure | Moderate |

**Arizona-Specific Factors:**
- Expansive clay soil can swell **10% or more** when wet
- Phoenix metro has localized areas with particularly high shrink/swell potential
- Areas like Fountain Hills: soil expands when wet and may NOT contract when dry
- Monsoon season causes rapid moisture changes
- Soil has been dry for millions of years, making it susceptible to heave when moisture enters

**Heave vs. Settlement - Critical Distinction:**
- **Heave:** Soil expands under foundation, pushing it UP. Common cause: improper drainage from roof runoff
- **Settlement:** Foundation sinks into soil. Common cause: soil consolidation or erosion
- Symptoms are similar, but solutions are completely different
- Underpinning (piers) CANNOT fix heave - may actually worsen the problem

### Professional Inspection Criteria

**[High Confidence]** Arizona follows ASHI 2023 Standards of Practice (effective May 25, 2024):

**Required Inspection Elements:**
1. Describe foundation type, floor structure, wall structure
2. Visual inspection of accessible areas
3. Probe structural components where deterioration is suspected
4. Enter underfloor crawl spaces when accessible
5. Report signs of water penetration
6. Report signs of abnormal condensation

**ASHI vs. InterNACHI Comparison:**

| Standard | Foundation Requirements |
|----------|------------------------|
| ASHI | Visual inspection required; no engineering analysis |
| InterNACHI | Report visible signs of movement (cracks, out-of-square doors, unlevel floors) |
| Both | Not required to determine adequacy of structural systems |

**Professional Inspection Process:**
1. Walk property interior and exterior
2. Check for obvious damage signs (cracks, gaps, water marks)
3. Use laser level or digital zip level to measure floor heights
4. Detect uneven settlement or heaving
5. Document findings with photos

### Visual Warning Signs for Assessment

**[High Confidence]** Key indicators to look for during property evaluation:

| Crack Type | Severity | Indication |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Stair-step (mortar joints) | High | Foundation settlement or heave |
| Horizontal | High | Lateral soil pressure, oxidizing rebar |
| Diagonal (30-70 degrees) | High | Differential settlement |
| Vertical (hairline) | Low-Medium | Normal settling, monitor only |
| Widening cracks | Critical | Active foundation movement |

**Other Warning Signs:**

| Sign | What It Indicates | Severity |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| Sticking doors/windows | Foundation movement | Medium-High |
| Gaps between floor and baseboards | Settlement or heave | Medium |
| Cracked floor tiles | Foundation movement | Medium |
| Sloping/uneven floors | Differential settlement | High |
| Cracks in drywall (especially corners) | Structural stress | Medium |
| Water stains in basement/slab area | Moisture intrusion | Medium |

**When to Call a Professional:**
- Horizontal cracks in stem wall
- Stair-step cracks in brick/block
- Visible slab movement
- Multiple warning signs present
- Cracks wider than 1/4 inch

### Arizona ROC Contractor Requirements

**[High Confidence]** Foundation repair in Arizona requires proper licensing:

**License Classification:** A-7 Piers and Foundations
- Allows: Installation of piers and foundations using concrete, rebar, post-tension, pile driving, excavation, forming
- Separate licenses for commercial vs. residential work
- Dual licenses available for both

**Requirements:**
- Business entity registration with Arizona Corporation Commission
- Qualifying Party with necessary experience and skills
- Pass Statutes & Rules Exam (SRE) and Trade Exam
- Surety bond ($2,500 - $100,000 depending on volume)
- Criminal background checks
- 18+ age requirement

**Consumer Protection:** Always verify contractor license at [roc.az.gov](https://roc.az.gov) before hiring.

### Foundation Repair Cost Ranges (2024)

**[Medium Confidence]** Phoenix-area foundation repair costs:

| Repair Type | Cost Range | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| Helical Piers | $2,000 - $3,000 per pier | Installed at 6-foot intervals |
| Push Piers | $2,000 - $3,000 per pier | Slightly less than helical |
| Foundation Stabilization (total) | $4,000 - $12,000+ | Depends on severity |
| Polyurethane Deep Injection | $150 - $180 per sq ft | For minimal settlement |
| Crack Repair (minor) | $300 - $500 | Per repair |

**Cost Estimation Formula:**
- Determine linear footage of affected area
- Multiply by $350 - $450 per linear foot
- Add costs for access complications (crawl spaces, indoor work)

**Factors Increasing Cost:**
- Limited access (tight crawl spaces)
- Indoor work requiring furniture protection
- Complex structural issues
- Multiple affected areas
- Post-tension slab complications
