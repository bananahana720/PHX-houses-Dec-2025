# Recommendations for PHX Houses Scoring System

### Pool Adjustments

**1. Monthly Cost Factor:**
Add $250-400/month to cost efficiency calculations for properties with pools:
- Conservative (DIY capable): $250/month
- Moderate (hybrid): $300/month
- Full service expected: $400/month

**2. Equipment Age Consideration:**
- Pool pump >8 years: Add $1,500 to near-term expenses
- Pool heater >12 years: Add $3,000 to near-term expenses
- Consider equipment age in Section B (Systems) scoring

### Solar Lease Kill-Switch

**RECOMMENDATION: Add Solar Lease as HARD KILL-SWITCH**

**Rationale [High Confidence]:**
1. 3-8% home value reduction directly impacts investment
2. 75% of Phoenix solar is leased = significant deal flow impact
3. Complicates resale (credit requirements, transfer process)
4. Escalating payments reduce cost efficiency over time
5. No appraisal value = financing complications

**Implementation:**
```
HARD Kill-Switch Criteria:
- HOA: Must be $0 (instant fail)
- Beds: Must be >= 4 (instant fail)
- Baths: Must be >= 2 (instant fail)
- Solar Lease: Must be NONE or OWNED (instant fail) [NEW]
```

**Alternative (if HARD seems too restrictive):**
Add as SOFT criterion with severity 2.5 (same as sewer):
- Combined with other soft factors would likely trigger fail anyway

### Owned Solar Bonus

**RECOMMENDATION: Add +5 points for Owned Solar**

**Rationale:**
- 4-6% value premium on resale
- Reduced monthly utility costs
- Growing buyer preference (57% of agents value energy efficiency features)

**Implementation:**
Add to Section A (Location) or Section B (Systems):
- Owned solar panels: +5 pts
- Solar lease or PPA: 0 pts (or kill-switch)
