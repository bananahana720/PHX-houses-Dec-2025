### 2. Electricity Costs (Pump Operation)

**Monthly Electricity by Pump Type:**

| Pump Type | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Energy Efficiency |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Single-speed | $40 - $150 | $480 - $1,800 | Lowest (phased out 2021) |
| Dual-speed | $30 - $80 | $360 - $960 | Medium |
| Variable-speed | $10 - $50 | $120 - $600 | Highest (30-70% savings) |

**Arizona-Specific Factors [High Confidence]:**
- AZ electricity rate: ~$0.1576/kWh (slightly below national average)
- Hot climate requires longer pump operation (6-12 hours/day vs 4-8 elsewhere)
- Summer months: 20-30% higher electricity costs
- Desert evaporation increases water pumping costs by 15-25%

**Energy Savings Recommendation:**
Variable-speed pumps are required for new installations (DOE efficiency rules since 2021). Energy Star-certified pumps can save $300+ annually.

### 3. Water Costs (Evaporation & Refill)

**Evaporation Rates [High Confidence]:**
- Summer: 1 inch per week (4-6 feet annually for uncovered pools)
- Equates to ~2,000 gallons/month loss for average pool
- Winter: 0.25 - 0.5 inches per week

**Water Costs (Phoenix 2024):**
- Evaporation refill: $20 - $50/month in summer
- Full pool refill (12,000 gal): ~$30 - $50
- Phoenix water rate: ~$1.15 per 1,000 gallons

**Phoenix-Specific Tip [Medium Confidence]:**
Do NOT drain/refill pools during January-March. These months set your annual sewer discharge rate calculation. Refill in Fall (October-November) when air temps are below 85F.

**2024 Rate Changes:**
Phoenix implemented 6.5% water rate increase in October 2023 (~$2/month for average user).

- Cracks, leaks, or corrosion
- Sudden spike in energy bills

**Arizona HVAC/Equipment Note:**
Arizona's extreme heat reduces equipment lifespan compared to cooler climates. Budget for the lower end of lifespan ranges.
