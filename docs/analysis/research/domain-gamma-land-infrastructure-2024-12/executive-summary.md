# Executive Summary

This research report covers three critical infrastructure areas for Phoenix metro residential property evaluation:

1. **Maricopa County Zoning GIS Data (DOM-07)**: Publicly accessible zoning data is available through multiple county portals including the Assessor's Parcel Viewer, Planning and Development GIS, and Open Data Portal. The county uses distinct zoning classifications from Phoenix city, with Rural-43 through Rural-190 districts for large-lot residential.

2. **Septic vs. City Sewer (DOM-08)**: City sewer is strongly preferred for PHX Houses analysis. Septic systems in Arizona face unique challenges including 10%+ failure rates, caliche soil drainage issues, and mandatory pre-sale inspections. Annual maintenance costs range $500-$1,000 while replacement costs can reach $20,000-$50,000.

3. **Arizona Water Rights (BONUS)**: The 2023 groundwater moratorium created a two-tier market. Properties within designated city water service areas (Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, Scottsdale, Tempe) have secure 100-year supplies. Outer suburban areas relying on groundwater (Buckeye, Queen Creek, parts of San Tan Valley) face development restrictions and potential long-term value risk.

### Key Recommendations for PHX Houses System

| Factor | Recommendation | Kill-Switch Impact |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Septic System | Add SOFT kill-switch (severity 2.5) | Properties with septic = higher risk |
| Water Service | Verify designated provider status | Non-designated areas = WARNING |
| Zoning | Document for lot size validation | R-43/R-190 = large lots expected |
