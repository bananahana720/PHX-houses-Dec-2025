# Conflicting Data Notes

1. **Septic System Costs:** Range varies significantly ($1,050-$20,000+ for new systems) depending on source and system type. Used Phoenix-specific data where available.

2. **Septic Lifespan:** General US data (15-40 years) vs. Arizona-specific (up to 30 years with maintenance). Arizona's soil challenges likely reduce averages.

3. **Water Impact on Value:** Limited quantitative research on actual property value impacts from water restrictions. Qualitative evidence strong that it affects development costs and buyer perception.
