# DOM-08: Septic vs. City Sewer - Costs and Risks

### 1. Overview: Septic Prevalence in Arizona

**[High Confidence]**

| Statistic | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Septic systems in Arizona | 500,000+ | ADEQ |
| Arizonans on septic | 1.2 million (20% of population) | ADEQ |
| Septic systems 30+ years old | 60%+ | ADEQ |
| Estimated failure rate | 10%+ | Arizona Department of Environmental Quality |

### 2. Annual Maintenance Costs

**[High Confidence]**

| Service | Cost Range | Frequency |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Visual inspection only | $200-$300 | Annual |
| Comprehensive inspection (with pumping) | $400-$650+ | Annual or as needed |
| Septic tank pumping | $360-$600 (AZ average) | Every 3-5 years |
| Total annual maintenance | $500-$1,000 | Varies |

**Additional Cost Factors:**
- Buried tank lids: Extra charge for digging ($50-$200)
- Urban locations: Higher costs
- Tank size: Larger = more expensive pumping
- Waste accumulation: More waste = higher pumping cost

### 3. Septic Inspection Requirements at Sale

**[High Confidence]** Arizona law mandates pre-sale septic inspection:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Inspection timing | Within 6 months prior to ownership transfer |
| Who pays | Seller must retain qualified inspector |
| Documentation | Report of Inspection form + permitting documents to buyer |
| Notice of Transfer | Buyer must submit within 15 days of closing |
| Transfer fee | $50 per parcel |
| Pumping requirement | Tank must be pumped at sale OR certified that pumping not needed |

**Legal Note:** This requirement takes precedence over any conflicting terms in the property transfer contract.

### 4. Septic System Lifespan in Arizona Soil

**[Medium Confidence]**

| Component | Typical Lifespan | Arizona-Specific Factors |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Septic tank | 15-40 years | Material, water table, soil acidity |
| Drain field (good soil) | 20-25 years | Soil permeability critical |
| Drain field (clay soil) | Considerably less | Arizona has many clay-heavy soils |
| Overall system (AZ average) | Up to 30 years | With proper maintenance |

#### Arizona Soil Challenges

**[High Confidence]** Desert soils present unique challenges:

1. **Caliche:** Dense calcium carbite layer common in AZ that prevents drainage
2. **Clay-heavy soils:** Slow drainage, soil compaction, oversaturation risk
3. **Summer heat (100F+):** Surface evaporation faster than percolation
4. **Low moisture:** Soil becomes too dry/hard for proper wastewater processing

**Quote:** "Arizona's tough terrain with sand and boulders, foothills and hardpan valley soils provide plenty of onsite challenges for septic system installers."

### 5. Septic Failure Risks and Replacement Costs

**[High Confidence]**

#### Failure Warning Signs

- Foul odors inside home or around system
- Slow drains throughout house
- Soft, wet, or spongy soil around drainfield (without rain)
- Sewage backups
- Pooling water in yard

#### Common Causes of Failure

1. **Improper maintenance** - Most common cause
2. **Solids migration** to drain field (from infrequent pumping)
3. **Leaks, cracks, component failures**
4. **Unsuitable soil conditions**
5. **High groundwater levels**
6. **Overloading** from high water usage

#### Cost Comparison

| Cost Category | Range | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Septic repair | $650-$3,100 | Component fixes |
| System replacement | $6,000-$50,000 | Depending on type and conditions |
| New anaerobic system | $3,000-$8,000 | More common, less efficient |
| New aerobic system | $15,000-$35,000 | More efficient, requires power |
| Total installation (Phoenix avg) | $4,950 | Range: $1,050-$8,850 |
| Full conventional system | $13,000-$20,000 | Includes soil testing, design, installation |

**Alternative Systems Required When:**
- Rocky or hard soil
- High water table
- Dense clay material

Types: Mound systems, evapotranspiration systems, aerobic systems, composting toilets

### 6. Why City Sewer is Preferred

**[High Confidence]**

| Factor | City Sewer | Septic System |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Upfront cost | Included in home price | May need replacement ($6k-$50k) |
| Annual maintenance | $0 (municipal fee only) | $500-$1,000 |
| Failure risk | Minimal | 10%+ in AZ |
| Pre-sale inspection | Not required | Mandatory + pumping |
| Property value impact | Neutral/positive | Negative if system old/poor |
| Soil limitations | None | Significant in AZ desert soil |
| Water conservation | No impact on system | Helps extend life |
| Chemical restrictions | Minimal | Strict (no bleach, chemicals, grease) |

**Property Value Impact:** A well-maintained septic system can maintain home value, but poor condition systems decrease value and deter buyers. Prospective buyers often request inspections, creating deal-breaking discoveries.

### PHX Houses System Integration

**Recommendation:** Add "Septic System" as SOFT kill-switch criterion with severity 2.5. Rationale:
- 10%+ failure rate in AZ
- $4,000-$20,000 average repair/replacement cost
- Pre-sale inspection requirement adds transaction friction
- Annual maintenance burden ($500-$1,000)
