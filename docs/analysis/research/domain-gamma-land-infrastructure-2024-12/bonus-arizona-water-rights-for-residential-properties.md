# BONUS: Arizona Water Rights for Residential Properties

### 1. Water Allocation Background

**[High Confidence]**

Arizona's 1980 Groundwater Management Act created the Assured Water Supply (AWS) program requiring proof of 100-year water supply for new subdivisions in Active Management Areas (AMAs).

#### The 2023 Groundwater Crisis

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| June 2023 | ADWR publishes new Phoenix AMA groundwater model |
| Finding | 4.86 million acre-feet unmet demand over 100 years |
| Result | Moratorium on new groundwater-based Certificates of AWS |
| Affected areas | Buckeye, Queen Creek, parts of San Tan Valley |
| Protected areas | Cities with Designation of AWS (DAWS) |

**Quote:** "The announcement sent a shock wave through Arizona's housing market and raised questions about the future of the sprawling Phoenix metroplex."

### 2. Impact on Property Values

**[Medium Confidence]**

#### Two-Tier Market Emerging

| Tier | Areas | Water Security | Property Value Outlook |
|------|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Tier 1: Secure** | Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, Scottsdale, Tempe | 100-year DAWS | Stable/positive |
| **Tier 2: At Risk** | Buckeye, Queen Creek, San Tan Valley (parts) | No DAWS, groundwater dependent | Uncertain, development constraints |

#### Tier 1 Details

- Most Phoenix area cities serve 90%+ of metro population
- City of Phoenix: ~2% groundwater, ~60% Salt/Verde Rivers, ~40% Colorado River
- Existing homeowners and certificates unaffected
- ~80,000 houses in development proceed as planned

#### Tier 2 Details

- Cannot get new groundwater-based Certificates of AWS
- Must secure alternative water sources (expensive, complex)
- Housing costs "significantly impacted" per Home Builders Association
- May face long-term value uncertainty

### 3. Areas with Most Secure Water Supply

**[High Confidence]**

#### Designated Water Providers (100-Year AWS)

The following have diverse water portfolios with renewable surface water sources:

| City/Provider | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Phoenix | DAWS | 60% SRP, 40% CAP, 2% groundwater |
| Mesa | DAWS | AMWUA member |
| Chandler | DAWS | AMWUA member, tech hub driving demand |
| Gilbert | DAWS | Strong sustained housing demand |
| Scottsdale | DAWS | AMWUA member |
| Tempe | DAWS | AMWUA member, ASU rental market |
| Glendale | DAWS | AMWUA member |
| Peoria | DAWS | AMWUA member |
| Goodyear | DAWS | AMWUA member |
| Avondale | DAWS | AMWUA member |
| City of Maricopa | DAWS | Global Water Resources serves (~23,000 AF/yr capacity, using ~8,000) |
| EPCOR West Valley | ADAWS (Oct 2025) | First new designation in 25 years, 60,000 homes enabled |

#### Areas Facing Challenges

| Area | Status | Key Concern |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Buckeye | Not designated | Relies almost exclusively on groundwater |
| Queen Creek | Partial | Southeast portions problematic |
| San Tan Valley | Partial | Phoenix AMA portions restricted |
| Teravalis (master planned) | Must secure own supply | 100-year renewable requirement |

### 4. 2024-2025 Regulatory Updates

**[High Confidence]**

| Date | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| June 2024 | ADWR updates Phoenix AMA model | Confirms no new groundwater-based CAWS |
| Nov 25, 2024 | ADAWS rules finalized | New path to designation without localized tests |
| Jan 2025 | Home Builders lawsuit | Challenges "unmet demand" metrics |
| Mar 2025 | Second lawsuit | Challenges 133% water buffer requirement |
| July 2025 | SB1611 (Ag-to-Urban) signed | Limits pumping from former farms to 1.5 AF/acre/year |
| Oct 2025 | EPCOR receives first ADAWS | First new 100-year designation in Phoenix AMA in 25 years |

**Colorado River Status:** Arizona faced Tier 1 shortage in 2024 with 18% cut from total Colorado River allocation. Tier 2 shortage upgraded from Tier 1.

### PHX Houses System Integration

**Recommendation:** Add water service verification to property evaluation:

1. **Verify designated provider status** for property location
2. **Flag properties outside DAWS service areas** with WARNING (not kill-switch, but note)
3. **Track water source diversity** as positive factor for long-term value

**Decision Matrix:**

| Water Status | PHX Houses Action |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Within DAWS city limits | PASS - secure supply |
| EPCOR West Valley service | PASS - newly designated |
| Buckeye city limits | WARNING - groundwater dependent |
| Queen Creek (SE portions) | WARNING - verify specific location |
| Outside all designated areas | STRONG WARNING - verify water rights |
