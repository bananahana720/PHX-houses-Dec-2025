**Research Date:** December 2024
**Region Focus:** Phoenix Metropolitan Area, Arizona
**Research Agent:** Claude Code Domain Research

---

## Executive Summary

This research report provides comprehensive data on building system lifespans in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area for integration into the PHX Houses Analysis Pipeline scoring system. Key findings indicate that Arizona's extreme desert climate significantly reduces the lifespan of major building systems compared to national averages.

### Key Findings

| System | Arizona Lifespan | National Average | Reduction |
|--------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| HVAC/AC | 8-15 years | 15-20 years | 20-40% |
| Asphalt Shingle Roof | 12-25 years | 20-30 years | 17-30% |
| Tile Roof (tiles) | 50-100 years | 50-100 years | None |
| Tile Roof (underlayment) | 12-20 years | 20-30 years | 33-40% |
| Foam/Flat Roof | 15-30 years | 20-30 years | 0-25% |

**Critical Insight for Scoring:** The Arizona HVAC penalty is severe. A 10-year-old HVAC unit in Phoenix has done the equivalent work of a 15-year-old system in moderate climates due to 30-40% more runtime hours annually.

## DOM-01: HVAC Lifespan in Phoenix

### Average Lifespan Ranges

| Source Type | Lifespan Estimate | Confidence |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| Local HVAC contractors | 8-12 years | High |
| Industry publications | 10-15 years | High |
| With proper maintenance | 12-15 years | Medium |
| Neglected systems | <10 years | High |

**[High Confidence]** The consensus from Arizona HVAC professionals is that air conditioning units last **8-15 years** in Phoenix, compared to the national average of 15-20 years. The most commonly cited range is **10-12 years** for typical residential installations.

### Impact of Extreme Heat (115F+)

**[High Confidence]** Arizona's extreme heat has multiple documented effects on HVAC systems:

1. **Runtime Penalty:** Systems in Phoenix experience 30-40% more runtime hours annually compared to moderate climates. This means a 10-year-old unit has effectively done 15 years of work.

2. **Efficiency Degradation:** Desert conditions cause approximately 2-3% annual efficiency loss compared to 1-2% in moderate climates. A 15-year-old system may operate at only 55-70% of original efficiency.

3. **Component Stress:**
   - **Compressors:** Leading cause of failure due to overheating when ambient temperatures exceed design specifications
   - **Capacitors:** Lifespan reduced from 20 years to potentially half that in extreme heat
   - **Fan Motors:** Operating at 115F ambient exceeds manufacturer specs; require quarterly bearing lubrication
   - **Ductwork:** Attic spaces reaching 150F cause accelerated deterioration and air leaks

4. **Temperature Differential:** Systems should maintain a 30-40F differential (if 100F outside, indoor temp should be ~60-70F). Settings lower than this force units to work beyond optimal operating range.

### Manufacturer Recommendations for Desert Climates

**[Medium Confidence]** Major brands have specific considerations for Arizona:

| Brand | Max SEER | Desert Notes |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Trane | 22 SEER2 | Emphasizes durability, widely available parts, tested in extreme conditions |
| Lennox | 28 SEER2 | Highest efficiency, but requires proprietary parts and specially trained technicians |
| Carrier | 24 SEER2 | Excel in efficiency and quiet operation |

**Key Recommendations:**
- Minimum 14 SEER required in Phoenix (building code)
- Higher SEER ratings (18+) recommended for desert efficiency
- Bi-annual professional maintenance critical (spring and fall)
- Quarterly filter changes during peak summer months

### Signs of HVAC Aging/Failure

**[High Confidence]** Warning signs documented by Phoenix HVAC professionals:

| Warning Sign | Severity | Action Required |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| Age 10+ years | Moderate | Plan replacement |
| Rising energy bills (>15% increase) | Moderate | Efficiency inspection |
| Frequent repairs (>2/year) | High | Consider replacement |
| Unusual noises (grinding, rattling, hissing) | High | Immediate service |
| Short cycling (frequent on/off) | High | Professional diagnosis |
| Poor cooling performance | Moderate | Service check |
| Burning odors | Critical | Shut off, emergency service |
| High humidity indoors | Moderate | System inspection |

**$5,000 Rule:** Multiply system age by repair cost. If result exceeds $5,000, replacement is more cost-effective than repair.

### Replacement Cost Ranges (2024)

**[High Confidence]** Based on Phoenix-area contractor quotes:

| System Type | Cost Range | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| Central AC only | $6,000 - $12,500 | Most common |
| Full HVAC (heat + cool) | $11,000 - $26,000 | Complete replacement |
| High-efficiency units | $15,000 - $26,000 | 18+ SEER systems |
| Budget options | $5,000 - $8,800 | Entry-level, lower SEER |

**Additional Costs:**
- Installation labor: $1,500 - $5,000
- Ductwork repair/replacement: $2,000 - $10,000
- City permits: $180 - $200
- Disposal of old unit: Included by most contractors

**Pro Tip:** Off-season installation (fall/winter) can save 10-15% on labor costs.

## DOM-02: Roof Lifespan by Material Type in Arizona

### Tile Roofs (Clay and Concrete)

**[High Confidence]** Tile roofs are the most common and durable option in Phoenix:

| Tile Type | Tile Lifespan | Underlayment Lifespan | Effective Roof Life |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Clay Tile | 50-100+ years | 12-20 years | 12-20 years between R&R |
| Concrete Tile | 40-60 years | 12-20 years | 12-20 years between R&R |

**Critical Insight:** The tiles themselves last decades, but the **underlayment** is the actual waterproofing layer. In Arizona:
- Underlayment typically needs replacement every **12-20 years**
- This requires a full tile "Remove & Replace" (R&R) typically every **13-16 years**
- Summer roof temperatures exceed **160F**, causing daily expansion/contraction stress
- UV radiation breaks down felt, dries flashing, and cracks sealants

### Asphalt Shingle Roofs

**[High Confidence]** Significantly shorter lifespan in Arizona:

| Shingle Type | Arizona Lifespan | National Average | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| 3-Tab Standard | 12-15 years | 15-20 years | Budget option |
| Architectural | 15-20 years | 20-30 years | Better durability |
| Premium/Designer | 18-25 years | 25-30 years | UV-resistant options |

**Heat/UV Degradation Factors:**
- Roofs lose 20-30% of expected lifespan due to heat and solar damage alone
- Temperature extremes (chilly nights to 115F+ days) cause expansion/contraction
- UV rays break down essential oils in shingles, reducing protective capacity
- Black shingles can reach **190F** vs. **150F** for light-colored options

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Light-colored/reflective shingles reduce thermal damage
- UV-resistant coatings can extend lifespan
- Regular inspections catch early degradation

### Flat/Foam Roofs (SPF - Sprayed Polyurethane Foam)

**[Medium Confidence]** Popular for flat roof applications:

| Maintenance Level | Lifespan | Recoat Interval |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Well-maintained | 25-30+ years | 7-10 years |
| Average maintenance | 15-25 years | 5-10 years |
| Neglected | 10-15 years | N/A |

**Key Considerations:**
- UV protective coating must be reapplied every 5-10 years
- Seamless protection ideal for Arizona's monsoon rains
- Excellent insulation properties reduce cooling costs
- Particularly suited for flat commercial/residential roofs

### Underlayment Failure Patterns

**[High Confidence]** Critical information for visual assessments:

| Underlayment Type | Arizona Performance | Recommendation |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Standard felt paper | Poor - deteriorates rapidly under UV, bubbles within 24 hours of exposure | Not recommended |
| Synthetic | Poor to Medium - many roofers report degradation in dry heat | Controversial for Arizona |
| Self-adhering (e.g., Boral Tile Secure) | Best - handles 6-12 months of UV exposure | Recommended for tile |
| Double-layer 40# felt | Good - common Arizona practice | Acceptable option |
| Modified bitumen (valleys) | Best for high-stress areas | Required in valleys |

**Important Note:** Many experienced Arizona roofers do NOT recommend synthetic underlayment under tile roofs due to:
- Non-self-sealing around nail penetrations
- Faster degradation in dry heat
- Lack of proven long-term performance in Arizona

### Replacement Cost Ranges (2024)

**[High Confidence]** Phoenix-area roofing costs:

| Roof Type | Cost per Sq Ft | 2,000 Sq Ft Home | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Asphalt Shingle (3-tab) | $3.50 - $5.50 | $7,000 - $11,000 | Budget option |
| Asphalt Shingle (architectural) | $6.00 - $8.00 | $12,000 - $16,000 | Better aesthetics |
| Concrete Tile | $8 - $15 | $16,000 - $30,000 | Most common in AZ |
| Clay Tile | $10 - $18 | $20,000 - $36,000 | Premium option |
| Foam/SPF | $1.50 - $6.00 | $3,000 - $12,000 | Flat roofs |
| Metal | $7 - $18 | $14,000 - $36,000 | Long-lasting |

**Additional Costs:**
- Old roof removal: $1 - $4 per sq ft ($2,000 - $8,000)
- Labor: 50-60% of total cost
- Permits/inspections: $100 - $500
- Underlayment upgrade: $500 - $2,000

**Pro Tip:** Roofing during off-season (fall/winter) can save 10-15% on labor.

## DOM-03: Arizona Foundation Inspection Standards

### Standard Foundation Types in Phoenix

**[High Confidence]** Arizona residential construction primarily uses:

| Foundation Type | Prevalence | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| Slab-on-Grade | Most Common | Concrete slab poured directly on ground |
| Post-Tension Slab | Common (newer homes) | Reinforced with tensioned steel cables |
| Standard Monolithic | Less Common | Rebar only around perimeter |

**Post-Tension Slab Details:**
- Contains horizontal grid pattern of steel reinforcement cable throughout slab
- Cables stretched to 25,000 psi with hydraulic jacks after concrete cures
- Creates a foundation that maintains shape with less cracking
- Provides flexibility important in Arizona's shifting soils
- Common in areas with expansive soil (Gilbert, Chandler, Cave Creek, parts of Scottsdale, north Phoenix)

**Note:** The majority of Phoenix homes do NOT have post-tension slabs. Builders use them primarily in high-risk expansive soil areas or when seeking to reduce warranty claims from cracked slabs.

### Common Foundation Issues in Arizona

**[High Confidence]** Expansive clay soil is the primary cause of foundation problems:

| Issue | Cause | Prevalence |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Heave | Wet soil expansion pushing foundation up | High (monsoon season) |
| Settlement | Soil contraction/consolidation | High (dry periods) |
| Cracking | Differential movement | Very High |
| Wall bowing | Lateral soil pressure | Moderate |

**Arizona-Specific Factors:**
- Expansive clay soil can swell **10% or more** when wet
- Phoenix metro has localized areas with particularly high shrink/swell potential
- Areas like Fountain Hills: soil expands when wet and may NOT contract when dry
- Monsoon season causes rapid moisture changes
- Soil has been dry for millions of years, making it susceptible to heave when moisture enters

**Heave vs. Settlement - Critical Distinction:**
- **Heave:** Soil expands under foundation, pushing it UP. Common cause: improper drainage from roof runoff
- **Settlement:** Foundation sinks into soil. Common cause: soil consolidation or erosion
- Symptoms are similar, but solutions are completely different
- Underpinning (piers) CANNOT fix heave - may actually worsen the problem

### Professional Inspection Criteria

**[High Confidence]** Arizona follows ASHI 2023 Standards of Practice (effective May 25, 2024):

**Required Inspection Elements:**
1. Describe foundation type, floor structure, wall structure
2. Visual inspection of accessible areas
3. Probe structural components where deterioration is suspected
4. Enter underfloor crawl spaces when accessible
5. Report signs of water penetration
6. Report signs of abnormal condensation

**ASHI vs. InterNACHI Comparison:**

| Standard | Foundation Requirements |
|----------|------------------------|
| ASHI | Visual inspection required; no engineering analysis |
| InterNACHI | Report visible signs of movement (cracks, out-of-square doors, unlevel floors) |
| Both | Not required to determine adequacy of structural systems |

**Professional Inspection Process:**
1. Walk property interior and exterior
2. Check for obvious damage signs (cracks, gaps, water marks)
3. Use laser level or digital zip level to measure floor heights
4. Detect uneven settlement or heaving
5. Document findings with photos

### Visual Warning Signs for Assessment

**[High Confidence]** Key indicators to look for during property evaluation:

| Crack Type | Severity | Indication |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Stair-step (mortar joints) | High | Foundation settlement or heave |
| Horizontal | High | Lateral soil pressure, oxidizing rebar |
| Diagonal (30-70 degrees) | High | Differential settlement |
| Vertical (hairline) | Low-Medium | Normal settling, monitor only |
| Widening cracks | Critical | Active foundation movement |

**Other Warning Signs:**

| Sign | What It Indicates | Severity |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| Sticking doors/windows | Foundation movement | Medium-High |
| Gaps between floor and baseboards | Settlement or heave | Medium |
| Cracked floor tiles | Foundation movement | Medium |
| Sloping/uneven floors | Differential settlement | High |
| Cracks in drywall (especially corners) | Structural stress | Medium |
| Water stains in basement/slab area | Moisture intrusion | Medium |

**When to Call a Professional:**
- Horizontal cracks in stem wall
- Stair-step cracks in brick/block
- Visible slab movement
- Multiple warning signs present
- Cracks wider than 1/4 inch

### Arizona ROC Contractor Requirements

**[High Confidence]** Foundation repair in Arizona requires proper licensing:

**License Classification:** A-7 Piers and Foundations
- Allows: Installation of piers and foundations using concrete, rebar, post-tension, pile driving, excavation, forming
- Separate licenses for commercial vs. residential work
- Dual licenses available for both

**Requirements:**
- Business entity registration with Arizona Corporation Commission
- Qualifying Party with necessary experience and skills
- Pass Statutes & Rules Exam (SRE) and Trade Exam
- Surety bond ($2,500 - $100,000 depending on volume)
- Criminal background checks
- 18+ age requirement

**Consumer Protection:** Always verify contractor license at [roc.az.gov](https://roc.az.gov) before hiring.

### Foundation Repair Cost Ranges (2024)

**[Medium Confidence]** Phoenix-area foundation repair costs:

| Repair Type | Cost Range | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| Helical Piers | $2,000 - $3,000 per pier | Installed at 6-foot intervals |
| Push Piers | $2,000 - $3,000 per pier | Slightly less than helical |
| Foundation Stabilization (total) | $4,000 - $12,000+ | Depends on severity |
| Polyurethane Deep Injection | $150 - $180 per sq ft | For minimal settlement |
| Crack Repair (minor) | $300 - $500 | Per repair |

**Cost Estimation Formula:**
- Determine linear footage of affected area
- Multiply by $350 - $450 per linear foot
- Add costs for access complications (crawl spaces, indoor work)

**Factors Increasing Cost:**
- Limited access (tight crawl spaces)
- Indoor work requiring furniture protection
- Complex structural issues
- Multiple affected areas
- Post-tension slab complications

## Recommendations for PHX Houses Scoring System

Based on this research, the following adjustments are recommended for the scoring system:

### HVAC Scoring Adjustments

**Current Assumption:** HVAC lasts 20+ years
**Recommended Adjustment:** Use 10-15 year lifespan for Arizona

| HVAC Age | Scoring Impact | Rationale |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| 0-5 years | Full points | New system, minimal concern |
| 6-10 years | Moderate deduction | Approaching mid-life in Arizona |
| 11-15 years | Significant deduction | End-of-life territory |
| 15+ years | Major deduction + cost flag | Replacement likely needed |

**Additional Factors:**
- Deduct points for unknown maintenance history
- Bonus points for documented bi-annual maintenance
- Consider brand (Trane/Carrier preferred for parts availability)

### Roof Scoring Adjustments

**For Tile Roofs:**
| Factor | Scoring Approach |
|--------|------------------|
| Tile age | Less important than underlayment |
| Underlayment age | Key factor - assume R&R needed every 15 years |
| Last R&R date | If unknown and roof >12 years, budget for R&R |
| Visible damage | Deduct for cracked/displaced tiles |

**For Shingle Roofs:**
| Age | Scoring Impact |
|-----|----------------|
| 0-8 years | Full points |
| 9-15 years | Moderate deduction |
| 15-20 years | Significant deduction |
| 20+ years | Major deduction, replacement imminent |

### Foundation Scoring Adjustments

| Factor | Scoring Approach |
|--------|------------------|
| Post-tension slab | Slight bonus (better crack resistance) |
| Expansive soil area | Flag for closer inspection |
| Visible cracks (stair-step/horizontal) | Major deduction |
| Sticking doors/windows | Moderate deduction, note for inspection |
| Year built pre-1990 | Consider settling risk |

### Cost Budget Recommendations

Include these replacement cost estimates in deal sheet calculations:

| System | Budget Amount | Timing Trigger |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| HVAC | $12,000 - $18,000 | Age 12+ years |
| Tile Roof R&R | $15,000 - $25,000 | Last R&R 12+ years ago |
| Shingle Roof | $10,000 - $16,000 | Age 15+ years |
| Foundation Repair | $6,000 - $15,000 | If warning signs present |

---

## Data Quality Notes

### Confidence Level Summary

| Research Area | Overall Confidence | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| HVAC Lifespan | High | Strong consensus across sources |
| HVAC Costs | High | Multiple recent contractor quotes |
| Tile Roof Lifespan | High | Well-documented in Arizona |
| Underlayment Issues | High | Critical Arizona-specific factor |
| Shingle Roof Lifespan | High | Clear data on UV/heat impact |
| Foam Roof | Medium | Some variation in sources |
| Foundation Types | High | Building code documented |
| Expansive Soil Issues | High | Well-researched topic |
| Foundation Costs | Medium | Highly variable by project |

### Conflicting Data Points

1. **HVAC Lifespan:** Ranges from 8-15 years depending on source. Conservative estimate of 10-12 years recommended for scoring.

2. **Synthetic Underlayment:** Conflicting recommendations - some sources recommend, Arizona roofers often warn against. Recommend flagging as risk factor.

3. **Foam Roof Lifespan:** Ranges from 15-30+ years. Maintenance-dependent, use 20 years as conservative estimate.

### Areas Needing Further Research

1. Home warranty claim data for Arizona (HVAC/roof failure rates)
2. Insurance industry statistics on roof claims by material type
3. Post-tension slab failure rates vs. standard slabs
4. Solar panel installation impact on roof underlayment
5. Ground water level changes affecting expansive soil behavior
