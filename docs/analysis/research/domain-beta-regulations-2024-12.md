# Arizona Regulatory Research Report: Domain-Beta

**Report Date:** December 2024
**Research Focus:** HOA Disclosure, Solar Lease Transfers, New Construction Warranties
**Jurisdiction:** Arizona (Phoenix Metro Focus)

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides comprehensive research findings on three critical Arizona regulatory areas affecting the PHX Houses Analysis Pipeline:

1. **HOA Disclosure Requirements (DOM-04)**: Arizona has robust HOA disclosure requirements under A.R.S. Section 33-1806, requiring sellers to provide detailed financial and governance information within 10 days. Buyers have review periods and associations face civil penalties up to $1,200 for fee violations.

2. **Solar Lease Transfer Regulations (DOM-05)**: Arizona requires extensive disclosures under A.R.S. Section 44-1763 for solar system agreements. Lease transfers during home sales are complex, require buyer credit qualification, and face significant complications from industry bankruptcies (8+ major solar companies failed since 2023).

3. **New Construction Defect Warranty (DOM-06)**: Arizona provides strong homebuyer protections with an implied warranty of workmanship and habitability that cannot be waived (Zambrano v. M & RC, 2022). Buyers have up to 8-9 years to pursue claims for latent defects. The Purchaser Dwelling Act requires 90-day pre-litigation notice.

**Key Kill-Switch Recommendations:**
- HOA fee > $0 remains a HARD kill-switch (appropriate)
- Solar leases should trigger WARNING status (not hard fail) with investigation
- 2024-built homes carry warranty risk but are protected by Arizona's strong implied warranty laws

## Recommendations for PHX Houses Kill-Switch Criteria

### Current Kill-Switch Analysis

| Criterion | Current Status | Recommendation | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| HOA fee > $0 | HARD kill | **MAINTAIN** | Strong disclosure laws, but ongoing costs and foreclosure risk |
| Solar lease present | Not in criteria | **ADD as SOFT (severity 2.0)** | Transfer complications, bankruptcy risk, DTI impact |
| Year built = 2024 | SOFT (severity 2.0) | **MAINTAIN** | Strong warranty protection mitigates risk |

### Proposed New Criteria

#### Solar Lease Detection

| Condition | Action | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Solar lease detected | WARNING | 2.0 |
| Escalating solar lease | WARNING | 2.5 |
| Solar company bankruptcy/unknown | WARNING | 3.0 |
| Solar loan (not lease) | INFO | 0.5 |
| Owned solar (no encumbrance) | PASS | 0.0 |

**Rationale:**
- Transfer requires buyer credit qualification
- Lenders may count payments in DTI (reducing buying power)
- 100+ solar companies bankrupt since 2023
- Transfer fees and complications add closing friction
- November 2025 form changes indicate industry recognizes problems

#### HOA Verification Enhancement

| Check | Purpose | Priority |
|-------|---------|----------|
| County Recorder CC&R search | Confirm HOA existence | High |
| Verify HOA fee amount | Ensure $0 or disclosed | High |
| Check ADRE dispute history | Flag problem HOAs | Medium |
| Review special assessments | Hidden costs | Medium |

### Data Collection Recommendations

| Field | Source | Phase |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `hoa_fee` | Listing data, disclosure | Phase 1 |
| `hoa_verified` | County Recorder search | Phase 1 |
| `solar_type` | Listing, disclosure | Phase 1 |
| `solar_lease_company` | Solar documents | Phase 1 |
| `solar_lease_payment` | Solar documents | Phase 1 |
| `solar_lease_escalating` | Solar documents | Phase 1 |
| `year_built` | County Assessor | Phase 0 |
| `builder_name` | County/listing | Phase 0 |
| `builder_roc_complaints` | ROC database | Phase 1 |

## Confidence Level Summary

| Topic | Overall Confidence | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| HOA Disclosure Requirements | **High** | Based on direct statutory text |
| HOA Fee Limits | **High** | Explicit in A.R.S. Section 33-1806 |
| HOA Verification Methods | **Medium** | Multiple sources, some unofficial |
| Solar Disclosure Requirements | **High** | Based on direct statutory text |
| Solar Transfer Process | **High** | AAR forms and FAQs |
| Solar Bankruptcy Impact | **High** | Widely reported news |
| Construction Warranty Law | **High** | Supreme Court ruling |
| Pre-Litigation Requirements | **High** | Direct statutory text |
| Construction Quality Trends | **Medium** | Inspector reports, anecdotal |

---

## Conflicting Data Notes

1. **HOA Document Validity Period**: No statutory expiration specified, but industry practice treats as valid ~30 days. Title companies may require updates.

2. **Solar Lease DTI Treatment**: Varies by lender and whether production guarantee exists. Not uniformly applied.

3. **New Construction Quality**: Inspector claims "no house passes inspection" but this may reflect inspection rigor rather than objective quality decline. Pandemic-era quality issues reportedly improving.

4. **Implied Warranty Duration**: Some sources cite 8 years, others 9 years. The statute provides 8 years with a 1-year extension if defect discovered in year 8.
