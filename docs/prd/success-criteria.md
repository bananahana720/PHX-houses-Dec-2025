# Success Criteria

### User Success

**Primary Success Scenario:** Confidently rule out bad properties through systematic elimination.

Success is NOT "find the perfect house" — it's "never accidentally pursue a bad one." The system wins when:

1. **Every property I consider has passed rigorous filtering** — no time wasted on deal-breakers
2. **I understand WHERE my points came from** — transparent score breakdowns by dimension with key contributing factors, not black-box numbers
3. **Hidden risks are surfaced BEFORE emotional investment** — bullets dodged, not discovered at inspection
4. **Decision fatigue is minimized** — batch analysis replaces manual Zillow research

**The Win Condition:** Go under contract on a property that:
- Scores 450+ with high confidence
- Passes ALL non-negotiable criteria
- Has no surprises discovered during due diligence that the system should have caught

### Business Success

| Milestone | Target Date | Success Criteria |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **System Operational** | Dec 2025 | Kill-switches + scoring + deal sheets working |
| **Property Pipeline Active** | Jan 2026 | 50+ properties evaluated, shortlist of 5-10 |
| **Under Contract** | Jan-Feb 2026 | Offer accepted on 450+ score property |
| **Close of Escrow** | Mar-Apr 2026 | Purchase complete, no post-close surprises |

**Post-Purchase Validation:** 6 months after move-in, no major issues surface that the system should have predicted.

### Technical Success

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Kill-switch accuracy | 100% | Zero false passes on non-negotiables |
| Scoring consistency | ±5 points on re-run | Deterministic, reproducible results |
| Batch processing time | <30 min for 20 properties | Usable in a single session |
| Data freshness | <7 days for listing data | Market moves fast |
| Explanation clarity | Self-service understanding | Don't need to debug the system to trust it |
