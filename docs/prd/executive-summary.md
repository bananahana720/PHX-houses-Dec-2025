# Executive Summary

**PHX Houses Analysis Pipeline** is a personal decision support system that evaluates Phoenix-area residential properties against strict first-time homebuyer criteria. The system transforms raw listing data into actionable intelligence through multi-agent analysis, risk detection, and comprehensive deal sheets.

### Vision

Enable confident, data-driven home purchase decisions by systematically surfacing both obvious deal-breakers and hidden risks that could impact long-term ownership satisfaction — while reducing the decision anxiety that makes home buying one of life's most stressful experiences.

### Problem Statement

First-time homebuyers face **asymmetric risk exposure** — they bear 100% of the financial consequences while having access to maybe 20% of the relevant decision factors.

1. **Arizona-specific factors are invisible** — HVAC units fail 20-40% faster than national averages, solar leases create hidden liabilities, pool ownership costs $300-400/month
2. **Generic tools miss local context** — National real estate platforms don't account for desert climate impacts, groundwater restrictions, or Phoenix market dynamics
3. **Risk discovery is reactive** — Buyers typically learn about septic failures, flood zones, or HOA restrictions after emotional investment in a property
4. **Decision fatigue is real** — Manually evaluating dozens of properties across 20+ criteria is exhausting and error-prone
5. **Emotional cost compounds** — The stress of uncertainty leads to decision paralysis or buyer's remorse

### Solution

A personal decision support system that:
- **Filters aggressively** via kill-switch criteria (HOA, beds, baths, solar leases, flood zones)
- **Scores comprehensively** across 600 points (Location 230, Systems 180, Interior 190)
- **Explains transparently** why each property scored as it did
- **Warns proactively** about hidden concerns with confidence levels
- **Adapts flexibly** — raw data preserved for re-scoring when priorities shift

### What Makes This Special

**Proactive Risk Intelligence** — The system doesn't just filter and rank; it surfaces unknown unknowns and connects them to consequences you actually care about:

| Consequence | Risk Sources | Why It Matters | Confidence |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| **Surprise $10K+ expense** | HVAC age, roof underlayment, foundation, pool equipment | Cash reserve wipeout | Medium |
| **Resale value hit** | Flood zone, flight path, solar lease, water security | Equity erosion | High |
| **Daily quality of life** | Noise, crime, wildlife corridors, HOA disputes | Regret accumulation | Medium |
| **Time sink** | Septic maintenance, long commute, poor walkability | Opportunity cost | Medium |

**The "Aha" Moments:**

| Moment | What Happens | Emotional Payoff |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **"NOW I understand"** | Score breakdown shows exactly why a property felt wrong | Clarity replaces gut unease |
| **"This is THE one"** | Property passes all kill-switches, scores 500+, deal sheet confirms | Confidence to act decisively |
| **"Bullet dodged"** | Warning surfaces hidden risk (solar lease, flood zone, septic age) | Relief — avoided a $50K mistake |
| **"My priorities shifted"** | Re-score with different weights when commute matters more than yard | System adapts, data preserved |
