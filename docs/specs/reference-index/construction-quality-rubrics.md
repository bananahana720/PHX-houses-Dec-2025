### 7. Exterior Construction Quality Reference

**File:** `.claude/skills/image-assessment/reference-exterior-quality.md`
**Word Count:** ~4,500 words
**Status:** Research complete (per plan lines 296-304)

**Contents:**
- Roof assessment (tile vs shingle vs flat, AZ lifespan adjustments)
- Stucco condition (crack classification, desert climate impact)
- Windows (single vs dual pane identification, Low-E indicators)
- Landscaping (xeriscape value, water savings calculations)
- Pool & outdoor (equipment age scoring, safety compliance)
- Cost impact estimates for each category

**Key Topics:**
1. **Roof Types:**
   - Tile (concrete vs clay): 30-50 year lifespan (AZ conditions)
   - Shingle: 15-25 years (reduced in AZ heat)
   - Flat: 10-15 years (common in older homes)

2. **Stucco Cracks:**
   - Hairline (<1/16"): Normal settling
   - Small (1/16"-1/4"): Monitor
   - Large (>1/4"): Structural concern

3. **Window Efficiency:**
   - Single pane: High cooling costs
   - Dual pane: Standard
   - Low-E coating: Premium (5-15% energy savings)

4. **Xeriscaping:**
   - Water savings: 30-70% vs traditional lawn
   - Property value impact: +2-5% in AZ market
   - Maintenance costs: -$50-100/month

**Usage:**
- Wave 2: Roof condition cost estimates
- Image assessment: Visual scoring rubric
- AI prompts: Exterior quality inference

**Integration Points:**
- Scoring: Roof condition strategy (50 pts)
- Cost Estimation: Maintenance reserve calculations

- Master suite (bathroom features, bedroom size indicators)
- Natural light, ceilings, fireplace, laundry scoring
- Flooring type identification (hardwood vs laminate vs LVP vs tile)
- Era-based calibration tables (1985 vs 1995 vs 2005 vs 2015 vs 2023)
- Photo quality confidence scoring system

**Key Topics:**
1. **Kitchen Scoring Factors:**
   - Cabinet quality: Particle board (2-4 pts) → Custom wood (9-10 pts)
   - Countertops: Laminate (2-4 pts) → Granite/quartz (8-10 pts)

   - Closet: Reach-in (2-4 pts) → Walk-in (8-10 pts)
   - Bathroom: Single sink (3-5 pts) → Dual vanity + separate tub (9-10 pts)
   - Privacy: Adjacent to other rooms (2-4 pts) → Separated wing (8-10 pts)

3. **Flooring Identification:**
   - Carpet: Neutral (5 pts), condition-dependent
   - Vinyl/laminate: 3-6 pts depending on quality
   - LVP (luxury vinyl plank): 6-8 pts (modern upgrade)
   - Tile: 7-9 pts (AZ climate appropriate)
   - Hardwood: 8-10 pts (rare/premium in AZ)

4. **Era Calibration:**
   - 1985: Earth tones, popcorn ceilings, linoleum
   - 1995: Builder beige, standard appliances
   - 2005: Granite counters, stainless appliances
   - 2015: Gray tones, open concept, LVP
   - 2023: Smart home, quartz counters, minimalism

**Usage:**
- Image assessment: Score Section C interior features (190 pts)
- Era calibration: Adjust expectations by year built
- AI prompts: Detailed rubric for inference

**Integration Points:**
- Scoring: Section C strategies (kitchen, master, light, ceilings)
- Data Quality: Photo quality confidence scoring
