# Arizona-Specific Research

### 5. Government & Environment Reference

**File:** `.claude/skills/arizona-context/reference-government-environment.md`
**Word Count:** ~8,000 words
**Status:** Research complete (per plan document lines 287-295)

**Contents:**
- Government regulations (HOA laws, property tax, solar, pool safety, sewer)
- Environmental factors (heat island, flood zones, air quality, water scarcity)
- Utilities (SRP vs APS rates, water providers, infrastructure age)
- Market factors (insurance costs, pool costs, roof/HVAC lifespan)
- Scoring implications and red flags
- 50+ data source citations

**Key Topics:**
1. **HOA Regulations:**
   - Arizona HOA laws (minimal state oversight)
   - Special assessment risks
   - Governance structures

2. **Solar Considerations:**
   - Owned vs leased systems
   - Transfer complications
   - Cost-benefit analysis

3. **Pool Costs:**
   - Service: $100-150/month
   - Equipment replacement cycles (AZ heat impact)
   - Energy costs: +$50-100/month

4. **HVAC Lifespan:**
   - AZ: 10-15 years (vs 20+ national average)
   - Dual-zone importance for 2-story homes
   - Replacement costs: $4k-8k

5. **Utility Rates:**
   - SRP vs APS tiered pricing
   - Summer peak rates (May-October)
   - Water scarcity impact on rates

**Usage:**
- Wave 2: Reference utility rates for cost estimation
- Scoring decisions: Understand AZ-specific factors
- AI prompts: Provide context for inference

**Integration Points:**
- Cost Estimation: Pool, HVAC, solar costs
- Scoring: Orientation scoring (cooling cost impact)
- Kill-Switch: Sewer type considerations
