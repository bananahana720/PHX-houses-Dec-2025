# Executive Summary

The enrichment_data.json contains legacy and redundant fields accumulated during development. This document catalogs fields for future cleanup without modifying the current data. Three main categories need attention:

1. **Synonym Fields** - Duplicate scoring fields with different naming conventions
2. **Computed Fields** - Runtime calculations stored unnecessarily
3. **Orphaned Metadata** - Source and confidence fields with unclear utility
