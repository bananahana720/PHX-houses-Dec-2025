# 10. Conclusion

**Current Status:** enrichment_data.json has accumulated 117 fields over development, with clear categories for consolidation.

**Recommendation:**
1. Execute Phase 1 (synonyms) at next sprint - low risk, immediate benefit
2. Execute Phase 2 (computed fields) during cost estimation refactor - medium effort, high benefit
3. Pause Phase 3 until LineageTracker fully validated

**Next Steps:**
1. Run investigation script from Section 7 to verify usage
2. Create `INVESTIGATION.md` with findings
3. Update design spec with canonical field names
4. Add validation to pipeline to prevent re-addition of removed fields
