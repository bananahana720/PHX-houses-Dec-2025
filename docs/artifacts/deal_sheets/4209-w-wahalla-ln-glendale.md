## Recommendation

**Verdict:** NEEDS INSPECTION - Strong fundamentals but over budget

### Suggested Offer Strategy
- **Maximum Offer:** $580,000 (7.2% below ask)
- **Rationale:** Bring monthly payment closer to $4,000 target
- **Expected Monthly at $580k:** ~$4,065/month (still $65 over but manageable)

### Contingencies to Include
1. Professional home inspection with focus on HVAC condition/age
2. Roof inspection for remaining life and leak history
3. Pool inspection (verify recent equipment replacement claims)
4. Verify no upcoming special assessments or road improvements
5. Request seller records for HVAC service history

### Before Making Offer
- [ ] Visit property to assess sun orientation (critical for cooling costs)
- [ ] Drive commute during rush hour to verify 40-minute estimate
- [ ] Verify grocery store distance and quality of options
- [ ] Check neighborhood for noise (highway distance 3.0 miles is good)
- [ ] Research Deer Valley schools - confirm boundaries and ratings
- [ ] Review county records for any liens or code violations
- [ ] Check flood zone status (unlikely in Glendale but verify)

### Red Flags to Watch For
- HVAC older than 7 years (seller estimate may be inaccurate)
- Roof damage or multiple repairs (Arizona sun is harsh)
- Pool plaster/tile condition (equipment age ≠ pool surface condition)
- Foundation cracks (rare in Arizona but check corners/walls)
- Evidence of settling or drainage issues

---

**Bottom Line:** Strong contender with excellent schools and recent pool/roof updates, but the 40-minute commute and $625k price push it over budget. Only pursue if seller accepts $580k or below, and only after confirming HVAC has 5+ years remaining life.
