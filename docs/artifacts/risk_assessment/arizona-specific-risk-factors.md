# ARIZONA-SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS

### Climate Impact on Systems
1. **Roof Degradation:** Arizona sun + monsoons = 15-20 year lifespan (vs 25-30 in moderate climates)
2. **HVAC Stress:** Running 6+ months/year = 10-15 year lifespan (vs 20+ elsewhere)
3. **Pool Equipment:** Chemical balance difficult in heat, evaporation stress = 8-12 years

### Pre-1970 Construction Concerns
**Properties at Risk:** 5004 W Kaler Dr (1958), 4342 W Claremont St (1957), 5522 W Carol Ave (1960), 8714 E Plaza Ave (1961), 8426 E Lincoln Dr (1966)

**Common Issues:**
- Clay sewer pipes (crack/root intrusion)
- Galvanized plumbing (rust buildup)
- Aluminum wiring (fire hazard)
- 100A electrical service (insufficient for modern loads)
- Asbestos insulation/flooring
- Foundation settling in desert soil

### Solar Panel Considerations
**Owned Solar (Value-Add):**
- 4417 W Sandra Cir (owned) - Reduces electric bills, adds value
- 7233 W Corrine Dr (owned) - But complicates roof replacement ($3-5k extra)
- 4417 W Sandra Cir (owned) - Best value with owned solar

**Leased Solar (Risk):**
- 16814 N 31st Ave (leased, unknown cost) - **GET LEASE DETAILS IMMEDIATELY**
- Typical lease: $100-200/month
- Transfer complications
- Roof replacement requires coordination with solar company
