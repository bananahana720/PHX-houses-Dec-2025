# CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS

### Before Making Offers
1. **16814 N 31st Ave:** Obtain solar lease agreement, monthly cost, buyout terms
2. **All Pre-1970 Properties:** Sewer line camera inspection ($200-400)
3. **High-Risk Properties:** Get roofing quotes BEFORE offer to verify replacement costs

### Inspection Must-Haves
1. **Roof age >15 years:** Independent roofing inspection, not just home inspector
2. **HVAC age >10 years:** HVAC technician testing, efficiency measurement
3. **Pool equipment age >8 years:** Pool service evaluation of all equipment
4. **Pre-1970 homes:** Electrical panel inspection, plumbing material identification
5. **Solar panels:** Inverter inspection, panel warranty verification

### Negotiation Strategy
- **High Risk Properties:** Request $15-25k seller credit for immediate repairs
- **Medium Risk Properties:** Request $5-10k seller credit for anticipated repairs
- **Leased Solar:** Request lease buyout or $10-15k credit if lease is expensive
