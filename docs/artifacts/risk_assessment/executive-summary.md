# Executive Summary

This report evaluates maintenance risk across all properties that passed kill-switch criteria. Properties are categorized by risk level based on the age of major systems (roof, HVAC, pool equipment) and structural concerns (year built).

**Key Findings:**
- **5 High Risk Properties:** Require immediate major repairs ($15,000-35,000)
- **9 Medium Risk Properties:** Systems approaching end-of-life ($8,000-20,000)
- **10 Low Risk Properties:** Recently updated or newer construction

**Arizona-Specific Considerations:**
- Roof lifespan: 15-20 years (harsh sun/monsoons)
- HVAC lifespan: 10-15 years (extreme heat stress)
- Pool equipment: 8-12 years typical replacement cycle
- Pre-1970 homes: Higher plumbing/electrical risk
