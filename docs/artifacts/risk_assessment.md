# Property Risk Assessment Report
*Phoenix Metropolitan Area - First-Time Home Buyer Analysis*

**Generated:** 2025-11-30
**Properties Analyzed:** 24 passing properties

---

## Executive Summary

This report evaluates maintenance risk across all properties that passed kill-switch criteria. Properties are categorized by risk level based on the age of major systems (roof, HVAC, pool equipment) and structural concerns (year built).

**Key Findings:**
- **5 High Risk Properties:** Require immediate major repairs ($15,000-35,000)
- **9 Medium Risk Properties:** Systems approaching end-of-life ($8,000-20,000)
- **10 Low Risk Properties:** Recently updated or newer construction

**Arizona-Specific Considerations:**
- Roof lifespan: 15-20 years (harsh sun/monsoons)
- HVAC lifespan: 10-15 years (extreme heat stress)
- Pool equipment: 8-12 years typical replacement cycle
- Pre-1970 homes: Higher plumbing/electrical risk

## ARIZONA-SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS

### Climate Impact on Systems
1. **Roof Degradation:** Arizona sun + monsoons = 15-20 year lifespan (vs 25-30 in moderate climates)
2. **HVAC Stress:** Running 6+ months/year = 10-15 year lifespan (vs 20+ elsewhere)
3. **Pool Equipment:** Chemical balance difficult in heat, evaporation stress = 8-12 years

### Pre-1970 Construction Concerns
**Properties at Risk:** 5004 W Kaler Dr (1958), 4342 W Claremont St (1957), 5522 W Carol Ave (1960), 8714 E Plaza Ave (1961), 8426 E Lincoln Dr (1966)

**Common Issues:**
- Clay sewer pipes (crack/root intrusion)
- Galvanized plumbing (rust buildup)
- Aluminum wiring (fire hazard)
- 100A electrical service (insufficient for modern loads)
- Asbestos insulation/flooring
- Foundation settling in desert soil

### Solar Panel Considerations
**Owned Solar (Value-Add):**
- 4417 W Sandra Cir (owned) - Reduces electric bills, adds value
- 7233 W Corrine Dr (owned) - But complicates roof replacement ($3-5k extra)
- 4417 W Sandra Cir (owned) - Best value with owned solar

**Leased Solar (Risk):**
- 16814 N 31st Ave (leased, unknown cost) - **GET LEASE DETAILS IMMEDIATELY**
- Typical lease: $100-200/month
- Transfer complications
- Roof replacement requires coordination with solar company

## RECOMMENDATIONS BY BUYER PROFILE

### Conservative Buyer (Low Risk Tolerance)
**Best Properties:**
1. 2353 W Tierra Buena Ln ($499,900) - Highest score, all new systems
2. 4417 W Sandra Cir ($415,000) - Lowest price, owned solar, new systems
3. 4732 W Davis Rd ($475,000) - All new systems, good value
4. 2344 W Marconi Ave ($560,000) - All new systems, top schools
5. 4136 W Hearn Rd ($457,000) - All new systems, huge lot

**Avoid:** All high-risk and pre-1970 properties

### Value Investor (Medium Risk Tolerance)
**Best Properties:**
1. 4209 W Wahalla Ln ($625,000) - 11-year roof/7-year HVAC manageable, 3-car garage
2. 2846 W Villa Rita Dr ($540,000) - 10-year roof but north-facing, 5-bed
3. 14014 N 39th Ave ($495,000) - Budget for HVAC replacement in 3-5 years
4. 8931 W Villa Rita Dr ($549,900) - Newer construction, pool equipment only concern

**Negotiate:** Use aging systems as leverage for $10-15k price reduction

### Bargain Hunter (High Risk Tolerance)
**Best Properties:**
1. 4001 W Libby St ($458,000) - Budget $20k for roof/pool, still good value
2. 13307 N 84th Ave ($490,000) - Same repairs but better schools (8.2 vs 8.4)
3. 5522 W Carol Ave ($442,000) - Low price, systems OK, accept school rating (6.7)

**High Risk/High Reward:**
- 5004 W Kaler Dr ($459,900) - Massive lot but infrastructure gamble
- 4342 W Claremont St ($514,800) - Large lot but infrastructure gamble

**Avoid:**
- 16814 N 31st Ave - Unknown solar lease is too risky
- 8803 N 105th Dr - School rating (4.0) will kill resale value

## CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS

### Before Making Offers
1. **16814 N 31st Ave:** Obtain solar lease agreement, monthly cost, buyout terms
2. **All Pre-1970 Properties:** Sewer line camera inspection ($200-400)
3. **High-Risk Properties:** Get roofing quotes BEFORE offer to verify replacement costs

### Inspection Must-Haves
1. **Roof age >15 years:** Independent roofing inspection, not just home inspector
2. **HVAC age >10 years:** HVAC technician testing, efficiency measurement
3. **Pool equipment age >8 years:** Pool service evaluation of all equipment
4. **Pre-1970 homes:** Electrical panel inspection, plumbing material identification
5. **Solar panels:** Inverter inspection, panel warranty verification

### Negotiation Strategy
- **High Risk Properties:** Request $15-25k seller credit for immediate repairs
- **Medium Risk Properties:** Request $5-10k seller credit for anticipated repairs
- **Leased Solar:** Request lease buyout or $10-15k credit if lease is expensive
