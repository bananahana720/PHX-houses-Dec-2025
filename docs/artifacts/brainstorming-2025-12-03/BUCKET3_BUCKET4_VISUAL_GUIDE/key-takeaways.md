# KEY TAKEAWAYS

### Bucket 3 (Claude Architecture)
✓ **CLAUDE.md per directory** - 7/7 directories covered
✓ **Narrow context loading** - Each file loads only what its directory needs
✓ **Update triggers documented** - Staleness checks, auto-creation hooks
✓ **Knowledge graphs as indexes** - toolkit.json, context-management.json
✓ **Token-efficient format** - Lists/tables > prose, code examples > explanations

### Bucket 4 (Tool Hierarchy)
✓ **6-tier system implemented** - Native tools, scripts, skills, agents, slash commands, MCP
✓ **Zero violations** - No bash cat/grep/find in critical paths
✓ **Tool scoping** - Skills declare allowed-tools, restrictions enforced
✓ **Decision tree available** - Quick reference for tool selection
✓ **10 orchestration axioms** - Prevent common multi-agent failures

### Overall Maturity: 9/10
This is a **reference implementation** for Claude Code project organization.
