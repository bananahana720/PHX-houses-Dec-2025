# CONCLUSION

The PHX Houses project has a **solid foundation** (kill-switch + 600-point scoring) and is ready for focused refinement. The 9 initiatives above address the major vision-implementation gaps while building toward a **comprehensive decision support platform**.

**Key Takeaway**: Start with #1-2 (kill-switch flexibility + section breakdowns) for quick wins that improve both coverage and clarity. Follow with #3-6 (foundation, commute, rubrics, what-if) to close major capability gaps. Reserve #7-9 (zoning, energy, dashboard) for next quarter as strategic, high-effort efforts.

The system can go from **80% vision alignment → 95%+ alignment** with disciplined, prioritized effort over the next 2-3 months.
