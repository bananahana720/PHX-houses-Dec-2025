TOP 5 CRITICAL GAPS:
====================
1. IP-01: No background jobs (30+ min blocks)        Effort: 5 days
2. IP-02: No job queue (sequential processing)       Effort: 4 days
3. XT-01: No field-level lineage (audit gap)         Effort: 4 days
4. XT-09: Scoring is black box (UX blocker)          Effort: 3 days
5. VB-01: No score interpretability (trust issue)    Effort: 3 days

CRITICAL PATH ISSUES:
======================
Image Pipeline Foundation (must do first):
  IP-01 → IP-02 → IP-03 → IP-04
  Effort: 14 days to unblock batch processing

Explanation Layer (parallel path):
  XT-01 → XT-09 → VB-01
  Effort: 10 days to provide user confidence

Configuration Management (parallel path):
  XT-05 → XT-06 → XT-07 → XT-08
  Effort: 7 days to enable A/B testing

QUICK WINS (≤2 days, high value):
===================================
1. Tool violation linter (CA-03)            2 days → HIGH impact
2. Skill discovery CLI (CA-04)              1 day  → MEDIUM impact
3. Move constants to env vars (XT-08)       2 days → HIGH impact
4. Index extraction logs (XT-04)            1 day  → MEDIUM impact
5. Runtime staleness checks (CA-02)         2 days → MEDIUM impact
6. Flood insurance cost lookup (VB-08)      2 days → LOW impact
7. "Next tier" guidance (XT-12)             2 days → MEDIUM impact

Total Quick Win Effort: 7 days for +5 UX improvements

RISK FACTORS:
===============
1. Image pipeline redesign (MEDIUM probability, CRITICAL impact)
2. Explanation generation inconsistency (LOW probability, MEDIUM impact)
3. Data lineage reveals quality issues (HIGH probability, MEDIUM impact)
4. Hard-coded tests break with config changes (MEDIUM probability, MEDIUM impact)

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
====================
Phase 1 (4 weeks): $24,000 → 8 properties in 10 min (was 30 min)
Phase 2 (4 weeks): $24,000 → 100 properties in 30 min (was 6 hours)
Phase 3 (4 weeks): $24,000 → 1000+ properties, full API

Total Investment: $72,000 for 60 days effort
Payoff: Single-property analysis → portfolio-level analysis ($500 → $10,000+ value)
ROI: Breaks even at 8 portfolio analyses

IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:
========================
Week 1:  Image pipeline foundation (5 days)
Week 2:  Explanation layer (5 days)
Week 3:  Data lineage (5 days)
Week 4:  Scoring enrichment (5 days)
Week 5:  Worker pool + retries (5 days)
Week 6:  Configuration management (5 days)
Week 7:  Advanced scoring (5 days)
Week 8:  Architecture automation (5 days)
Weeks 9-12: Analytics, API, documentation (20 days)

MILESTONE DATES:
=================
Week 4:  Production readiness (batch processing, explanations, lineage)
Week 8:  Scale readiness (1000+ properties, configuration-driven)
Week 12: Public release (complete system, API, documentation)

KEY METRICS:
==============
Current System Completeness: 62% (vision 80%, architecture 95%, operations 40%)
Target System Completeness: 100% (all buckets 95%+)

Current Throughput: 16 properties/hour (30+ min for 8)
Phase 1 Throughput: 48 properties/hour (10 min for 8)
Phase 2 Throughput: 200 properties/hour (30 min for 100)

Current Scalability: Single property only
Phase 1 Scalability: Batch up to 30 properties
Phase 2 Scalability: Unlimited with worker pool

Current Explainability: 40% (calculations work, no reasoning)
Phase 1 Explainability: 90% (natural language explanations)
Phase 2 Explainability: 100% (complete audit trail + recommendations)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
===================
Phase 1 Checkpoints:
  ☐ 8 properties in <10 minutes
  ☐ Natural language explanations for each score
  ☐ 100% field lineage populated
  ☐ All tests passing
  ☐ Foundation assessment live

Phase 2 Checkpoints:
  ☐ 100 properties in <30 minutes
  ☐ Zero data loss on crash
  ☐ Config changes without redeploy
  ☐ Autonomous retries working
  ☐ 24/7 batch processing stable

Phase 3 Checkpoints:
  ☐ 1000+ properties in <2 hours
  ☐ User satisfaction >4/5 on explanations
  ☐ Zero audit findings on lineage
  ☐ Complete API documentation
  ☐ Public release ready

PROJECT CONTEXT:
==================
Project: PHX Houses Pipeline
Version: 1.0.0 (partial)
Current Status: 62% complete (operational for single properties)
Target Status: 100% complete (production batch system)

Codebase:
  - 136 Python source files
  - 42 test files
  - ~6,000 lines of domain code
  - ~1,000 lines of configuration
  - ~200 lines of CLAUDE.md documentation per directory

Team Recommendation:
  - 1-2 engineers for 12 weeks full-time
  - OR 2-3 engineers for 6 weeks full-time
  - Prioritize Phase 1 (blocking issues) before Phase 2/3

Stakeholder Impact:
  - HIGH: Users cannot process batches >5 properties (Phase 1 required)
  - MEDIUM: Users confused by black-box scores (Phase 1 required)
  - LOW: Configuration changes require redeploy (Phase 2 optimization)
  - LOW: No portfolio-level analysis (Phase 3 feature)

Dependencies:
  - Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2
  - Phase 2 should complete before Phase 3
  - Quick Wins can be done in parallel with any phase
