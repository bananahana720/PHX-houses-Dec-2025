# CONCLUSION

The PHX Houses project has successfully implemented **80% of the envisioned buy-box criteria** with a well-architected, maintainable scoring and filtering system. The kill-switch logic is clear and effective. The 600-point scoring covers major buyer decision factors.

**Key Strengths**:
- Transparent, auditable filtering logic
- Modular, extensible scoring architecture
- Arizona-specific cost modeling
- Raw data preservation for re-scoring

**Key Opportunities**:
- Better interpretability (why this score?)
- Complete missing dimensions (zoning, foundation, energy efficiency)
- Enhanced decision support (what-if scenarios, offer timing)
- More sophisticated severity weighting (interaction effects, flexibility tiers)

The system provides a **solid foundation** for first-time home buyer decision support and is ready for the next phase of refinements to achieve 95%+ vision alignment.
