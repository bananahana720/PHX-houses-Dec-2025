# RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT STEPS

### Short-term (This Sprint)

4. Add percentile ranking to all property reports

### Medium-term (Next 1-2 Sprints)
1. Implement commute cost integration into affordability
2. Add foundation/structural assessment criteria
3. Create what-if scenario calculator
4. Refine kill-switch severity weighting (consider flexibility tiers)

### Strategic (Q1 2026)
1. Integrate zoning + development risk layer (Phase 0.5)
2. Build energy efficiency modeling (solar offset, kWh projection)
3. Implement decision support dashboard with offer timing signals
4. Create comprehensive risk assessment (foundation + HVAC + roof + electrical)
