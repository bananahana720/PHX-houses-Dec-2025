# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The PHX Houses project has a **well-architected scoring and filtering system** with clear separation between VISION requirements and IMPLEMENTATION. The current system is functional but reveals several strategic opportunities:

| Area | Status | Coverage |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Kill-Switch Filtering** | IMPLEMENTED | COMPLETE (7 criteria across 2 tiers) |
| **600-Point Scoring** | IMPLEMENTED | 95% complete (all major sections) |
| **Arizona-Specific Factors** | PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED | 60% (missing some climate/economics factors) |
| **Interpretability** | MODERATE | Scoring logic clear but explainability could be enhanced |
| **Data Preservation** | STRONG | CSV + JSON layered architecture supports re-scoring |
| **Resale Factors** | MODERATE | Some addressed (orientation, backyard), many implicit |
| **Economics** | GOOD | Monthly cost modeling implemented but incomplete |
