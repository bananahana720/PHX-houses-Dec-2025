# SUMMARY SCORECARD: VISION vs IMPLEMENTATION

| Dimension | Vision Requirement | Implementation | Completeness | Assessment |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Kill-Switch Filtering | Hard/soft 2-tier system | 7 criteria (3 hard, 4 soft) | 100% | COMPLETE |
| 600-Point Scoring | 3 sections × 6-7 criteria | 18 criteria across 3 sections | 95% | EXCELLENT |
| Arizona-Specific | HVAC, roof, pool lifespans, orientation | All included + air quality, flood zones | 85% | GOOD |
| Location Factors | Schools, safety, commute, amenities, growth, zoning, flood, heat | 8/9 captured (missing: zoning, growth trend) | 85% | GOOD |
| Condition Factors | Roof, foundation, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, layout, bones | 5/7 captured (missing: foundation, layout flow) | 70% | MODERATE |
| Climate Factors | Heat, power, outdoor living, water conservation | 2/4 captured (missing: power modeling, xeriscape) | 50% | WEAK |
| Economics Factors | Tax, HOA, utilities, insurance, commute, new vs old stock | 5/6 captured (missing: commute $ monetization) | 85% | GOOD |
| Resale Factors | Energy efficiency, outdoor spaces, pools, patios, parking, storage | 3/6 captured (missing: patio quality, storage, EE rating) | 50% | WEAK |
| Interpretability | Explain WHY good/bad | Scores only, no decision rationale generation | 30% | WEAK |
| Data Preservation | Raw data for re-scoring | CSV + JSON layered, weights configurable | 100% | EXCELLENT |
| Ranked Lists | Tier classification with rankings | Tier classification works, percentile ranking missing | 80% | GOOD |
| Historical Timeline | Price/status trends over time | No time-series tracking | 0% | MISSING |
| Visual Dashboards | Multiple dashboard views | Basic reports, could be richer | 50% | MODERATE |

**Overall Assessment**: **80% Vision Alignment**
- Core system (kill-switch + scoring) well-implemented
- Major gaps in: zoning/growth, foundation assessment, energy efficiency, commute cost, interpretability
- Quick wins available to boost to 90%
- Strategic effort needed to reach 95%
