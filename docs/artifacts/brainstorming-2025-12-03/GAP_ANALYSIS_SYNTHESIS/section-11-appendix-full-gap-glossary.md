# Section 11: Appendix - Full Gap Glossary

### Image Pipeline Terminology
- **Job Queue**: Abstraction for distributing image extraction across workers
- **Worker Pool**: Multiple parallel processes handling extraction
- **Circuit Breaker**: Pattern that disables failing data sources temporarily
- **Progress Visibility**: Real-time logging of extraction status
- **Crash Resilience**: Ability to resume after unexpected interruption

### Scoring & Evaluation
- **Interpretability**: Users understand why property received score
- **Explainability**: System generates human-readable reasoning
- **Reasoning Generation**: NLP templates that convert numeric scores to prose
- **Black Box**: System that produces output without showing its logic

### Data & Configuration
- **Field Lineage**: Tracking of data provenance (source, timestamp, confidence)
- **Schema Versioning**: Version control for data structure changes
- **Hard-Coded**: Values in source code vs. configuration files
- **A/B Testing**: Running two configurations simultaneously to compare results

### Operational
- **Autonomy**: System's ability to self-recover from failures
- **Evolvability**: Ease of adding new features or changing behavior
- **Traceability**: Ability to audit and trace all system operations
