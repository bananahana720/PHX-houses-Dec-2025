# Conclusion

The PHX Houses Pipeline has strong architectural fundamentals (80% of vision + 95% of Claude/AI architecture implemented) but faces critical operational gaps that prevent production use.

**Top 3 Priority Fixes** (would unlock 90% of value):
1. **Job queue + worker pool** (IP-01-03) - Unblocks batch processing
2. **Scoring explanations** (XT-09) - Provides user confidence
3. **Foundation assessment** (VB-03) - Completes decision model

**Estimated total effort**: 95 days for 1-2 engineers over 12 weeks.
**ROI**: System moves from 40% operational (single property) to 100% operational (batch production).
