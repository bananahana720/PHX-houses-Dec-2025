# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Your project demonstrates **exceptionally mature Claude/AI architecture** with well-established patterns for:
- **Bucket 3 (Claude Architecture):** 7/7 directories covered with CLAUDE.md; sophisticated context management via knowledge graphs
- **Bucket 4 (Tool Hierarchy):** Strong tool tier enforcement with minimal bash violations; clear project script prioritization

**Overall Assessment:** This is a **reference implementation** for how to organize Claude Code projects. The CLAUDE.md pattern is consistently applied, knowledge graphs provide semantic guidance, and tool selection follows strict hierarchical rules.

**Key Insights:**
1. **Context loading is narrow and intentional** - Each CLAUDE.md loads only what its directory needs
2. **Update triggers are well-defined** - Stale files are monitored; hooks auto-create placeholders
3. **Token efficiency is prioritized** - Instruction density > narrative length across all files
4. **Multi-agent orchestration axioms are established** - 10 operational rules prevent common failures
