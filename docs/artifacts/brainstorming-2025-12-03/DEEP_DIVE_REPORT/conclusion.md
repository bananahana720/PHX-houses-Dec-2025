# CONCLUSION

Your PHX Houses project demonstrates **exemplary Claude Code architecture**. The CLAUDE.md pattern is consistently applied, knowledge graphs provide semantic guidance, and the tool hierarchy enforces best practices.

**Key Strengths:**
1. Every directory has a purpose-driven CLAUDE.md
2. Knowledge graphs serve as executable indexes
3. Tool selection follows strict hierarchies (no ad-hoc bash)
4. Multi-agent axioms prevent common orchestration failures
5. Documentation is instruction-dense, not narrative-heavy

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement CI/CD checks for CLAUDE.md presence/quality
2. Add staleness verification before Phase 2 agent spawns
3. Build skill discovery CLI for programmatic access
4. Document hook implementation timeline

This architecture is **ready to scale** to 50+ agents with confidence that context management, tool usage, and orchestration patterns will remain consistent.
