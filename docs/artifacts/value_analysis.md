## 1. Value Score Methodology

**Value Efficiency Formula:**
```
Score Efficiency = Total Score / (Price / $100,000)
Points per $10k = Total Score / (Price / $10,000)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Higher efficiency = more scoring points per dollar spent
- Compares properties across different price points
- Identifies undervalued gems and overpriced listings
