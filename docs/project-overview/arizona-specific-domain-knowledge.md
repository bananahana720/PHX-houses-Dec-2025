# Arizona-Specific Domain Knowledge

The system incorporates deep Arizona real estate expertise:

### HVAC Lifespan (10-15 years, not 20+)
Arizona's extreme heat significantly reduces HVAC lifespan compared to national averages. Replacement cost: ~$8,000.

### Pool Economics ($250-400/month)
- Service: $125/month
- Energy (pump, heater): $75/month
- Equipment replacement: ~$5,500 every 8 years
- Scoring: No pool = 10pts neutral (no burden), not 0pts penalty

### Solar Lease Liability
Solar leases are liabilities, not assets:
- Monthly cost: $100-200
- Transfer complications on sale
- Buyer assumption required
- Impact: Captured in cost_efficiency scoring (35pts)

### Sun Orientation Critical
- **North-facing:** 25pts (best) - Minimal sun exposure, lowest cooling costs
- **East-facing:** 18.75pts - Morning sun only
- **South-facing:** 12.5pts - Moderate sun exposure
- **West-facing:** 0pts (worst) - Afternoon sun, highest AC costs
