# Conclusion

The PHX Houses Dec 2025 project has a **solid testing foundation** with excellent coverage of critical business logic (kill switches: 97%, cost estimation: 98%, scoring: 95%). However, **integration and orchestration layers** need attention (pipeline: 34%, analysis: 24%, tier classification: 26%).

By implementing the recommended 23 hours of test development across the 10 modules identified, **95% coverage is achievable** within the next 2-3 sprints, with immediate gains from fixing the 3 failing tests and adding pipeline/analyzer tests.

The project is well-structured for testing growth with clear separation of concerns and good fixture reuse patterns.
