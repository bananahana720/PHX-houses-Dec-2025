## ASHI Inspection Terms Glossary

### Exterior Terms

**Alligatoring:** Paint or roofing surface with pattern resembling alligator skin, indicating weathering and deterioration. Common on flat roofs and old oil-based paint.

**Blistering:** Paint bubbles caused by moisture or heat trapped under the surface. Indicates painting over damp surfaces or poor surface prep.

**Chalking:** Powdery residue on painted surfaces from UV degradation of paint binders. Normal aging but excessive chalking indicates poor-quality paint.

**Checking:** Fine cracks in wood, paint, or stucco from expansion/contraction cycles. Cosmetic unless deep or extensive.

**Delamination:** Separation of layers (plywood, OSB, paint, stucco). Indicates moisture intrusion, poor adhesion, or freeze-thaw damage.

**Efflorescence:** White crystalline salt deposits on masonry from water evaporation. Indicates moisture intrusion - source must be identified.

**Flashing:** Metal strips preventing water intrusion at roof/wall junctions, chimneys, skylights. Critical inspection point - often source of leaks.

**Friable:** Crumbly, easily crushed material (asbestos, damaged wood, deteriorated stucco). Safety concern if asbestos-containing material.

**Granule Loss:** Loss of protective mineral coating on asphalt shingles. Minor at edges/valleys is normal; widespread indicates end of life.

**Heaving:** Upward movement of concrete, pavers, or foundation from expansive soil, freeze-thaw, or tree roots.

**Ponding:** Standing water on flat roofs > 48 hours after rain. Accelerates deterioration, may indicate structural sagging.

**Sidelap/Headlap:** Overlapping edges of shingles. Inadequate overlap allows water intrusion and wind uplift.

**Spalling:** Chipping/flaking of concrete, brick, or masonry from freeze-thaw, salt damage, or reinforcement corrosion.

**Step Cracking:** Stair-step pattern cracks in brick/block walls following mortar joints. Indicates foundation settlement or soil movement.

**Weep Holes:** Small openings at bottom of brick veneer walls allowing moisture drainage. Blockage causes moisture problems.

### Roof Terms

**Buckling:** Distortion of roof sheathing or shingles from moisture, poor ventilation, or improper installation.

**Counter Flashing:** Upper flashing piece that overlaps base flashing at chimneys/walls. Critical leak prevention component.

**Crickets:** Small peaked structures behind chimneys directing water around obstruction. Absence increases leak risk.

**Cupping:** Shingle edges curling upward from moisture cycling or poor ventilation. Indicates aging, 5-10 years remaining life.

**Curling:** Shingle edges curling downward from age and thermal cycling. Indicates 3-5 years remaining life.

**Drip Edge:** Metal strip at roof edge directing water into gutters and protecting fascia. Required by code, often missing on older roofs.

**Hail Damage:** Circular impact marks, asphalt exposed, granules missing in spots. Insurance claim if recent storm.

**Ice Dam:** Ice buildup at eaves preventing drainage, causing water backup under shingles. Not applicable in Phoenix climate.

**Ridge Vent:** Continuous ventilation at roof peak. Superior to turbine vents for attic cooling (critical in Arizona).

**Sagging:** Visible roof depression indicating structural issues (undersized rafters, water damage, excessive load).

**Soffit Vents:** Intake vents under eaves allowing air into attic. Must be clear and balanced with exhaust vents (important in AZ for HVAC efficiency).

**Thermal Splitting:** Shingle cracking from extreme temperature cycles. Common in Arizona due to intense UV and high temps.

**Valley:** Roof angle where two planes meet, channeling heavy water flow. High-stress area requiring proper flashing.

### Foundation Terms

**Consolidation:** Gradual soil compression under foundation weight. Normal settling, but differential consolidation causes problems.

**Differential Settlement:** Uneven foundation movement causing structural stress. Evidenced by door/window issues, wall cracks.

**Expansive Soil:** Clay soils that swell when wet, shrink when dry. Major issue in Phoenix area requiring proper foundation design.

**Lateral Movement:** Horizontal foundation shifting from soil pressure, poor drainage, or tree roots.

**Pier and Beam:** Foundation with piers supporting beams. Accessible crawlspace but requires proper ventilation.

**Post-Tension Cables:** Steel cables in concrete slab compressed after pouring, creating stronger, thinner slabs. Common in Phoenix. **NEVER CUT.**

**Settlement:** Downward foundation movement from soil compression. Cracks > 1/4" or active movement requires structural engineer.

**Slab-on-Grade:** Concrete slab poured at ground level. Standard in Phoenix, no basement/crawlspace.

**Stemwall:** Short foundation wall supporting structure above ground. Common in Phoenix construction.

**Trench Footing:** Concrete footing poured in trench supporting foundation walls. Standard construction method.

### HVAC Terms

**AFUE:** Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency. 80% = builder grade, 90%+ = high efficiency. Not critical in Phoenix (rare heating use).

**BTU:** British Thermal Unit. Measure of heating/cooling capacity. Phoenix requires ~600-700 BTU/sqft due to extreme heat.

**Compressor:** Heart of AC system. Failure = $1,500-3,000 repair. Listen for grinding, chattering, hard starting.

**Condenser Coils:** Exterior unit coils releasing heat. Dirty coils reduce efficiency 20-30%, common in dusty Phoenix climate.

**Cross-Contamination:** Mixing of supply/return air or outdoor/indoor air. Poor installation, can waste 30% efficiency.

**Ductwork Leakage:** Unsealed duct joints losing 20-40% conditioned air. Major issue in Phoenix attics (120°F+).

**Evaporator Coils:** Indoor coils absorbing heat. Freezing indicates low refrigerant, poor airflow, or failed components.

**Haboob:** Phoenix dust storm that clogs AC units. Post-haboob coil cleaning essential for efficiency.

**Inadequate Airflow:** < 400 CFM per ton. Causes freezing coils, compressor damage, high bills. Often from dirty filters or blocked ducts.

**R-22 Refrigerant:** Old refrigerant phased out 2020. Expensive to refill ($150-200/lb), indicates system ready for replacement.

**R-410A:** Modern refrigerant. Higher pressure, not compatible with R-22 systems.

**SEER:** Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. 14 = minimum, 16 = good, 18+ = excellent. Critical in Phoenix for bill management.

**Short Cycling:** AC running < 10 minutes per cycle. Indicates oversized unit, thermostat issues, or failing components. Reduces efficiency and lifespan.

**Zoned System:** Separate climate control for different areas. Highly desirable in 2-story Phoenix homes (upstairs runs hot).

### Plumbing Terms

**Cross-Connection:** Link between potable and non-potable water. Code violation, health hazard.

**Drum Trap:** Old-style tub trap, collects debris, hard to clean. Common in pre-1950s homes, legal but problematic.

**Galvanized Pipe:** Steel pipe zinc-coated for corrosion resistance. Lifespan 40-50 years, corrodes from inside out, causes low pressure. Common in Phoenix homes 1940s-1970s.

**Gray Water System:** Reuses shower/sink water for landscaping. Increasingly common in drought-conscious Phoenix.

**Orangeburg Pipe:** Tar paper sewer pipe used 1940s-1970s. Collapses/deteriorates, often found in Phoenix, requires replacement.

**Polybutylene:** Gray plastic pipe used 1978-1995. Class-action failure history, many insurance companies won't cover. Immediate red flag.

**PEX:** Cross-linked polyethylene. Modern flexible piping, excellent for Phoenix (no corrosion, freeze-resistant).

**S-Trap:** Illegal trap configuration that can siphon, causing sewer gas entry. Must be replaced with P-trap.

**Sewer Lateral:** Homeowner-owned pipe from house to main sewer. Repair costs $3,000-15,000 if collapsed/root-invaded.

**Septic System:** On-site wastewater treatment. Pumping every 3-5 years ($300-500), failure = $10,000-30,000 replacement. **Major buyer concern** - many Phoenix buyers require city sewer.

**Trap:** U-shaped pipe holding water to block sewer gas. Every drain requires trap per code.

**Water Hammer:** Banging noise when valves close quickly. Indicates missing/failed arrestors, can damage pipes over time.

**Water Heater Anode Rod:** Sacrificial rod preventing tank corrosion. Should be checked every 3-5 years (rarely done). Neglect = premature failure.

### Electrical Terms

**Aluminum Wiring:** Used 1965-1973. Fire hazard at connections, requires special devices/methods. Insurance may require inspection/remediation.

**Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI):** Breaker detecting arcing conditions (fire prevention). Required in bedrooms/living areas per modern code.

**Double-Tap:** Two wires on breaker designed for one. Code violation, fire hazard, often found in homes with additions.

**Federal Pacific Panel:** Notorious defective panel (1950s-1980s). Breakers fail to trip, fire hazard. Replacement required by many insurance companies.

**Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI):** Outlet detecting ground faults, preventing electrocution. Required within 6' of water sources.

**Knob and Tube:** Obsolete wiring (pre-1940s). No grounding, cloth insulation, fire hazard. Rare in Phoenix but requires full rewire if present.

**Service Size:** 100A = minimum, 150A = standard, 200A = preferred for modern loads. Phoenix homes with pool typically need 200A.

**Two-Wire Romex:** Ungrounded wiring. Legal if installed pre-1960s but outlets should have "No Equipment Ground" labels.

### Interior Terms

**Bowed Floor:** Floor sagging between supports. Indicates undersized joists, water damage, or termite damage.

**Cosmetic Repair:** Minor visual defect not affecting function (scuff, small ding, stain). Budget $50-200.

**Functional Obsolescence:** Feature that's outdated but works (harvest gold appliances, single bathroom). Reduces value but not a defect.

**Maintenance Repair:** Normal wear requiring routine fix (caulking, weatherstripping, touch-up paint). Budget $100-500.

**Nail Pops:** Fastener protrusion through drywall from settlement/movement. Cosmetic unless widespread.

**Out of Level/Plumb:** Floor slope or wall tilt > 1/2" in 6'. May indicate foundation issues requiring investigation.

**Serviceable:** Component at/near end of design life but currently functional. Plan replacement within 1-5 years.

**Sticking Doors/Windows:** Difficult to operate from settlement, humidity changes, or poor installation.

**Water Staining:** Discoloration from moisture. Always investigate source - active leaks vs. past repair.

### General Condition Terms

**As-Is:** Sold without repairs. Buyer accepts all defects. Get comprehensive inspection to understand true costs.

**Deferred Maintenance:** Needed repairs that were postponed. Accumulates exponentially - small problems become large.

**Economic Life:** Expected functional lifespan considering maintenance and obsolescence, not just physical durability.

**Fair Condition:** Serviceable but showing age/wear. Needs maintenance but not major repairs. Budget 5-15% of value for updates within 5 years.

**Life Expectancy:** Expected remaining lifespan based on age, maintenance, climate. Use Arizona-adjusted values (see component tables below).

**Major Repair:** Structural or system component work > $2,500. Often requires permits and licensed contractors.

**Minor Repair:** Cosmetic or maintenance issue < $500. Typically DIY-capable or handyman work.

**Poor Condition:** Multiple systems/components at end of life or non-functional. Budget 15-30% of value for immediate repairs.

**Readily Accessible:** Visible/reachable without moving items or using special tools. Inspectors only assess accessible areas.

**Serviceable:** Currently functioning but showing wear. May be at/near replacement age. Plan for replacement within 2-3 years.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Converting Internal Kitchen Score to UAD

**Scenario:** Kitchen scored 7/10 based on photos

**Analysis:**
- **Materials:** Granite counters, stainless appliances, wood cabinets (not builder-grade)
- **Condition:** Clean, no damage, everything functional, minor wear on cabinet edges
- **Age:** Updated 2012 (13 years old)

**UAD Conversion:**
- **Quality:** Q3 (Good quality - above builder-grade materials)
- **Condition:** C3 (Good condition - normal wear for age, no deferred maintenance)
- **Update Status:** Updated (6-15 years ago)

**Deal Sheet Language:**
"Kitchen: Q3/C3, Updated 2012. Granite counters, stainless appliances, wood cabinets. Good quality materials in good condition with minor wear consistent with age. No deferred maintenance observed."

### Example 2: Roof Age Assessment from Photos

**Observations:**
- Architectural shingles, light brown color
- Some curling visible at edges
- Dark streaks in valleys (granule loss)
- No obvious damage or repairs
- Tile in neighbors' photos suggests 1990s-2000s neighborhood

**Analysis:**
- Curling + granule loss in valleys = 10-15 years old
- Color still decent, not widespread damage = not end of life yet
- Phoenix climate = assume lower end of lifespan

**Estimated Age:** 12-15 years old
**Remaining Life:** 3-8 years (mid-term replacement)
**Recommendation:** Budget $8,000-12,000 for replacement within 5 years

**Deal Sheet Language:**
"Roof: Architectural shingles, estimated 12-15 years old based on visible curling and granule loss. Serviceable but approaching replacement age (typical 20-year lifespan in Phoenix climate). Budget $10,000 for re-roof within 3-5 years."

### Example 3: HVAC Serial Number Decode

**Serial Number:** 0814A56789 (Carrier unit)
**Decode:** 0814 = Week 08, Year 2014
**Age:** 11 years old (as of 2025)

**Analysis:**
- Middle-aged for Phoenix climate (expect 10-15 years)
- Visual: Moderate rust, copper oxidation, working but louder
- No recent major repairs per seller disclosure

**Assessment:**
- **Condition:** C4 (Average condition, showing age)
- **Remaining Life:** 2-4 years likely
- **Action:** Plan for replacement within 1-3 years

**Deal Sheet Language:**
"HVAC: Carrier unit manufactured 2014 (11 years old). Unit currently functional but exhibiting age-related wear (oxidation, increased noise). Arizona climate reduces typical lifespan to 10-15 years. Recommend budgeting $6,500-9,000 for replacement within 2-3 years. Consider in offer negotiations."

## Integration with PHX Houses Scoring

### Section C: Interior Scoring (190 pts)

When assessing interior photos, use UAD Quality ratings to guide numerical scores:

| Component | Max Points | Q1-Q2 (9-10pts) | Q3 (7-8pts) | Q4 (5-6pts) | Q5-Q6 (1-4pts) |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Kitchen | 40 | Custom/luxury | Upgraded | Standard | Economy/dated |
| Master Bath | 40 | Spa-like | High-end | Functional | Basic/worn |
| Light/Windows | 30 | Abundant/premium | Good natural light | Adequate | Dark/small |
| Ceilings | 30 | Coffered/vaulted | 9-10ft flat | 8ft standard | Low/popcorn |
| Fireplace | 20 | Gas/feature | Standard functional | None/cosmetic | N/A |
| Laundry | 20 | Large/custom | Standard room | Closet/garage | None/shared |
| Aesthetics | 10 | Designer | Coordinated | Generic | Dated/poor |

### Section B: Systems Scoring (180 pts)

Use Condition ratings and age estimates:

| Component | Max Points | C1-C2 (9-10pts) | C3 (7-8pts) | C4 (5-6pts) | C5-C6 (1-4pts) |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Roof | 50 | New/< 5yrs | 5-10yrs | 10-15yrs | 15+yrs |
| HVAC (implied) | in Cost Efficiency | New/< 5yrs | 5-10yrs | 10-12yrs | 12+yrs |
| Plumbing (visible) | 40 | Modern fixtures | Updated | Standard | Old/issues |
| Pool (if present) | 20 | New/renovated | Maintained | Functional | Needs work |

**Scoring Guidelines:**
1. Start with UAD assessment (Quality + Condition)
2. Map to numerical score using tables above
3. Adjust ±1 point for subjective factors
4. Document UAD ratings in notes field
5. Flag end-of-life components in recommendations

## Summary

This skill bridges subjective property assessment and professional appraisal standards:

1. **UAD Quality (Q1-Q6):** Permanent characteristic - materials, craftsmanship, design
2. **UAD Condition (C1-C6):** Current state - maintenance, wear, functionality
3. **ASHI Terms:** Professional vocabulary for documenting findings
4. **Component Ages:** Estimate remaining life using visual indicators and climate adjustments
5. **Score Mapping:** Convert 1-10 scores to industry-standard UAD ratings

**Key Takeaway for Arizona Properties:**
- **Reduce standard lifespans 25-30%** for roof, HVAC, pool equipment
- **UV/heat exposure** dominates wear patterns
- **Dust/monsoons** require more frequent maintenance
- **Budget conservatively** - component failures expensive in extreme climate

Use this skill when writing deal sheets, estimating repair costs, communicating with agents/inspectors, or converting internal scores to professional terminology.
