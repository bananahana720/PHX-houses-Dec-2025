description: Arizona-specific real estate factors for property evaluation. Quick Ref provides era calibration, HVAC/pool age estimation for image assessment. Full Context includes sun orientation (30 pts critical), solar lease liabilities, pool economics ($150-400/mo), and AZ-adjusted lifespans (HVAC 10-15yr, roof 15-40yr). Use when evaluating AZ properties, estimating component ages, scoring orientation, or assessing visual property age.

# Arizona Real Estate Context

AZ-specific property evaluation factors that differ significantly from national averages.

---

## Quick Ref (Image Assessment)

### Era Calibration Table

| Era | Years | Visual Indicators |
|-----|-------|-------------------|
| Pre-1980 | <1980 | Smaller windows, flat roofs, carports |
| 1980s | 1980-89 | Arched doorways, brass fixtures, step-down living |
| 1990s | 1990-99 | Vaulted ceilings, plant shelves, oak cabinets |
| 2000s | 2000-09 | Open plan, granite counters, earth tones |
| 2010s | 2010-19 | Gray/white palette, shaker cabinets, quartz |
| 2020s | 2020+ | Smart home, waterfall islands, matte black |

**Era mismatch**: +5 pts for modern finishes in older home, -5 pts if dated throughout

### HVAC Visual Age Assessment

| Visual Condition | Estimated Age | Score Impact |
|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Clean housing, modern controls | 0-5 years | Full points |
| Minor weathering, some discoloration | 5-10 years | -2 pts |
| Visible rust, dated controls | 10-15 years | -5 pts |
| Heavy rust, deteriorated | 15+ years | -10 pts (budget $8-15k) |

### Pool Condition Indicators

| Indicator | Good | Fair | Poor |
|-----------|------|------|------|
| Tile line | Clean, intact | Some staining | Cracked, missing |
| Equipment | <10 yrs, clean | 10-15 yrs, weathered | >15 yrs, rusted |
| Water | Crystal clear | Slightly cloudy | Green, murky |

### Equipment Age from Photos

| Visual Cue | Age | Budget |
|------------|-----|--------|
| Variable speed pump, automation | 0-5 yrs | None |
| Single speed pump, basic filter | 5-10 yrs | $3-5k soon |
| Visible rust, old salt cell | 10+ yrs | $8-15k imminent |

## Full Context (Analysis)

### Sun Orientation (30 pts - CRITICAL)

| Direction | Points | Monthly Cooling Impact |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| **North** | 30 | Lowest cost |
| NE/NW | 25 | Low |
| East | 20 | Moderate-low |
| South | 10 | Moderate |
| SE/SW | 5 | High |
| **West** | 0 | +20-30% summer bills |

**Why:** Afternoon sun (3-8 PM) = peak electric rates. West-facing = brutal PM exposure.

**Clues in photos:**
- Shadow direction (morning = east-facing, afternoon = west)
- UV fading on west facades
- Full shade structures on west patios

### Solar Panel Economics

| Status | Monthly Impact | Risk | Score |
|--------|----------------|------|-------|
| **Owned** | -$100-200 savings | None | +10 pts |
| **Leased** | +$100-200 cost | HIGH | -20 pts |
| None | $0 | None | 0 pts |

**LEASED SOLAR RED FLAGS:**
- Buyer credit approval required
- $15-25k balloon at close possible
- 2-3%/year escalators
- 20-year commitment inherited

### Pool Economics (AZ-Specific)

| Cost Category | Monthly |
|---------------|---------|
| Service | $80-200 |
| Chemicals | $30-80 |
| Electricity | $40-120 |
| **Total** | $150-400 |

### Component Lifespans (AZ-Adjusted)

| Component | National | Arizona | Budget |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------|
| **HVAC** | 15-20 yrs | 10-15 yrs | $8,000-15,000 |
| Water Heater | 12-15 yrs | 8-12 yrs | $1,500-3,000 |
| Roof (tile) | 40-50 yrs | 25-40 yrs | $10,000-25,000 |
| Roof (shingle) | 20-25 yrs | 15-20 yrs | $8,000-15,000 |

**Rule of thumb:** Reduce national lifespan 25-30% for Arizona.

## Best Practices

1. **Orientation is non-negotiable** - Never default, always verify
2. **Reduce national lifespans 25-30%** for Arizona climate
3. **Solar leases are liabilities** - Treat like assuming debt
4. **Pool adds $200-400/mo** - Factor into affordability
5. **Check R-22 refrigerant** - Indicates HVAC replacement needed
