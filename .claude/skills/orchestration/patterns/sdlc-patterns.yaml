# SDLC Orchestration Patterns
# General software development lifecycle patterns

patterns:
  waterfall:
    description: Traditional sequential development
    phases: [requirements, design, implement, test, deploy]
    wave_type: sequential_orchestrated
    use_when: Fixed requirements, regulated industries

  agile-sprint:
    description: Iterative development with sprints
    phases: [planning, development, review, retrospective]
    wave_type: mixed
    iterations: true
    sprint_length: 2_weeks
    use_when: Evolving requirements, frequent feedback

  devops-cicd:
    description: Continuous integration and deployment
    phases: [commit, build, test, deploy, monitor]
    wave_type: automated_sequential
    automation: [github-actions, docker]
    use_when: Rapid deployment, automated testing

  incident-response:
    description: Production incident handling
    phases: [detect, triage, fix, validate, postmortem]
    wave_type: sequential_orchestrated
    escalation: [warn, page, escalate]
    use_when: Production issues, outages

  feature-development:
    description: New feature implementation
    phases: [design, implement, test, review, integrate]
    wave_type: mixed
    agents:
      design: architect-review
      implement: general-purpose
      test: test-automator
      review: code-reviewer
    use_when: New features, enhancements

agent_selection:
  exploration: Explore (quick|medium|thorough)
  implementation: general-purpose
  testing: test-automator, tdd-orchestrator
  review: code-reviewer, architect-review
  debugging: debugger, error-detective
