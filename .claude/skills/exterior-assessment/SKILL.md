## 1. Roof Visual Condition Protocol

### Arizona Tile Roof Indicators by Age

**NEW (0-5 years):**
- Uniform color across all tiles
- Sharp edges on tiles
- Clean valleys and flashing
- No visible underlayment
- Consistent alignment
- Minimal debris accumulation
- **Visual Score: 9-10**

**GOOD (6-15 years):**
- Slight color variation
- Minor fading from UV exposure
- Edges still intact
- Some dust accumulation in valleys
- All tiles present and properly seated
- No visible cracks
- **Visual Score: 7-8**

**FAIR (16-25 years):**
- Noticeable color fading
- Some tiles with rounded/worn edges
- 1-2 cracked or chipped tiles visible
- Valleys show accumulated debris
- Flashing shows some oxidation
- Possible minor underlayment exposure at edges
- **Visual Score: 5-6**

**POOR (26+ years or premature failure):**
- Significant fading/discoloration
- Multiple cracked or broken tiles
- Missing tiles
- Visible underlayment exposure
- Sagging areas
- Heavy moss/debris accumulation
- Flashing deterioration
- **Visual Score: 1-4**

### Shingle Roof Indicators

**NEW (0-8 years):**
- Uniform granule coverage
- No curling or cupping
- Straight lines, no warping
- Clean valleys
- Flashing in good condition
- **Visual Score: 9-10**

**GOOD (9-15 years):**
- Minimal granule loss
- Very slight curling at edges (normal)
- Color still mostly uniform
- **Visual Score: 7-8**

**FAIR (16-20 years):**
- Noticeable granule loss (dark patches)
- Curling/cupping more pronounced
- Some shingles show wear patterns
- **Visual Score: 5-6**

**POOR (21+ years or premature failure):**
- Significant granule loss
- Widespread curling/cupping
- Cracked or missing shingles
- Exposed underlayment
- Moss/algae growth
- **Visual Score: 1-4**

### Arizona-Specific Roof Degradation Factors

**UV Intensity Multiplier:**
- Phoenix UV index is extreme (11+) most of year
- Apply **-2 years effective life** for south/west-facing slopes
- Tile roofs handle Arizona sun better than shingles
- Expect shingle lifespan: 15-20 years (vs 20-25 national)
- Expect tile lifespan: 30-40 years (vs 50+ national)

**Monsoon Impact:**
- Look for granule accumulation in gutters (shingle)
- Check for displaced/broken tiles after storms
- Inspect valleys for debris accumulation
- High winds can cause premature shingle lifting

### Photo Analysis Priority

**Primary:**
1. **Aerial/drone photos** - Overall condition, pattern consistency
2. **Front exterior** - Roof line, flashing, valleys

**Secondary:**
3. **Side exterior** - Profile view for sagging, flashing detail
4. **Rear exterior** - Back slope condition

**Fallback:**
- If no aerial photos, use front exterior + side views
- If limited photos, note "limited visibility" in assessment

### Visual Scoring Rubric (1-10 Scale)

| Score | Condition | Action Required | Budget Impact |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| 9-10 | Excellent | None | $0 |
| 7-8 | Good | Monitor, plan ahead | $0-5k in 5+ years |
| 5-6 | Fair | Budget replacement 3-5 years | $8-15k soon |
| 3-4 | Poor | Replace within 1-2 years | $10-20k immediate |
| 1-2 | Critical | Replace immediately | $10-25k+ urgent |

**Roof Replacement Costs (Arizona):**
- Shingle roof: $5-8/sqft ($10-16k for 2000 sqft)
- Tile roof: $8-12/sqft ($16-24k for 2000 sqft)
- Emergency repairs: Add 20-30%

## 2. Pool Equipment Visual Age Protocol

### Equipment Components to Identify

**Primary Components:**
1. **Pump** - Motor housing, labels, condition
2. **Filter** - Tank style (sand/cartridge/DE), size, rust
3. **Heater** - Gas or electric, brand, corrosion
4. **Control Panel** - Automation system, wiring condition
5. **Salt Cell** (if present) - Inline chlorinator, buildup
6. **Cleaner** - Type (pressure-side, suction, robotic)

**Visual Inspection Points:**
- Equipment pad location (accessibility)
- Plumbing connections (PVC condition, unions)
- Electrical box condition
- Overall cleanliness/maintenance evidence

### Visual Age Estimation Matrix

**NEW (0-3 years):**
- Equipment labels crisp and readable
- No rust or corrosion on metal parts
- Clean, bright PVC pipes
- Modern control panel (digital display)
- Tight fittings, no leaks
- Fresh paint on metal components
- **Estimate: 0-3 years**

**GOOD (4-7 years):**
- Labels still readable but showing UV fade
- Minor surface rust on metal components
- PVC shows some sun fading
- Control panel functional, minor wear
- Fittings intact, possible minor calcium buildup
- **Estimate: 4-7 years**

**FAIR (8-12 years):**
- Labels faded or partially illegible
- Moderate rust/corrosion on metal parts
- PVC significantly sun-bleached
- Control panel dated but functional
- Some calcium/mineral buildup on pipes
- Minor leaks possible at connections
- **Estimate: 8-12 years**

**POOR (13+ years):**
- Labels missing or completely illegible
- Heavy rust, corrosion, pitting on metal
- PVC brittle-looking, possibly cracked
- Old mechanical controls (no digital)
- Heavy mineral deposits
- Visible leaks, temporary repairs
- Obsolete equipment brands
- **Estimate: 13+ years**

### Brand/Model Age Indicators

**Pump Brands (Modern → Legacy):**
- **Hayward Super Pump VS** (variable speed) - 2015+
- **Pentair IntelliFlo** (variable speed) - 2010+
- **Hayward Super Pump** (single speed) - 1990s-2020
- **Sta-Rite Dura-Glas** - 1980s-2000s (legacy)

**Visual Clues:**
- Variable speed pumps = post-2010 (energy efficiency regulations)
- Large metal motors = pre-2000s
- Digital controls = post-2005
- Mechanical time clocks = pre-2000s

### Arizona-Specific Degradation Factors

**Heat Impact:**
- Phoenix summer temps (110-120°F) accelerate equipment aging
- Apply **+20% aging factor** to all pool equipment
- Pump motors rated for 10 years → expect 8-9 years in Arizona
- Filter tanks rated for 15 years → expect 12-13 years

**Sun Exposure:**
- PVC pipes become brittle faster (7-10 years before issues)
- Equipment labels fade within 5 years
- Metal components rust faster with monsoon humidity

**Water Chemistry:**
- High calcium in Phoenix water accelerates buildup
- Salt systems corrode faster in hard water areas

### Budget Recommendations by Age

| Component | 0-5 years | 6-10 years | 11-15 years | 16+ years |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Pump** | $0 | $500 reserve | $1,200 replace | $1,500 urgent |
| **Filter** | $0 | $300 reserve | $800 replace | $1,000 urgent |
| **Heater** | $0 | $1,000 reserve | $2,500 replace | $3,000+ urgent |
| **Salt Cell** | $0 | $400 reserve | $800 replace | $1,000 urgent |
| **Total Budget** | $0 | $2,200 | $5,300 | $6,500+ |

**Complete Equipment Replacement:** $5,000-8,000 (all components)

### Photo Analysis Priority

**Primary:**
1. **Pool equipment pad** - Direct view of all equipment
2. **Close-up of pump** - Brand, model, condition
3. **Filter tank** - Size, rust, connections

**Secondary:**
4. **Control panel** - Age indicators, automation level
5. **Plumbing manifold** - PVC condition, valves

**Fallback:**
- If no equipment photos, note "unable to assess, budget $3k inspection reserve"
- If only distant shots, provide range estimate with caveat

## 3. HVAC Exterior Unit Protocol

### Brand/Model Age Indicators

**Common Arizona Brands:**
1. **Trane** - Model number format XR14/XR16 (year in serial)
2. **Carrier** - Model starts with 24A (year in serial)
3. **Lennox** - Model format 14ACX (year in serial)
4. **Goodman** - Model GSX13 (year in serial)
5. **Rheem** - Classic/Classic Plus (year in serial)

**Serial Number Decoding:**
- First 4 digits often encode manufacture date
- Format varies by brand (consult brand-specific guides)
- If visible in photo, can determine exact age

### Visual Age Estimation (When Serial Not Visible)

**NEW (0-5 years):**
- Modern square/rectangular cabinet design
- Pristine paint, no fading
- Clean coils visible through grille
- Newer-style condensing fan (curved blades)
- Energy Star or efficiency ratings sticker intact
- **Estimate: 0-5 years**

**GOOD (6-10 years):**
- Slight paint fading on top surface
- Cabinet edges show minor wear
- Coils still relatively clean
- Fan blades intact
- Stickers show UV fade
- **Estimate: 6-10 years**

**FAIR (11-15 years):**
- Noticeable paint oxidation
- Some rust spots on cabinet edges
- Coils show dust/debris accumulation
- Minor dents or impact damage
- Older cabinet design (rounder edges)
- **Estimate: 11-15 years**

**POOR (16+ years):**
- Significant rust/corrosion
- Heavy coil contamination visible
- Older rounded cabinet style
- Missing screws/panels
- Evidence of multiple repairs
- Faded/missing nameplate
- **Estimate: 16+ years**

### Arizona Heat Degradation Factor

**Phoenix-Specific Lifespan:**
- National average: 15-20 years
- Arizona average: **10-15 years**
- Extreme heat causes **-5 years effective life**

**Degradation Accelerators:**
1. **Direct sun exposure** - Units on south/west sides age faster
2. **Inadequate shade** - No awning/shade structure
3. **Dust exposure** - Monsoon dust clogs coils
4. **Continuous runtime** - 6+ months/year high usage
5. **Poor maintenance** - Dirty coils, bent fins

### Refrigerant Type Identification

**R-22 (Phased Out):**
- Units manufactured before 2010
- **Red flag:** Expensive to recharge ($150-200/lb)
- Refrigerant no longer produced (recycled only)
- Replacement strongly recommended

**R-410A (Current Standard):**
- Units manufactured 2010+
- More efficient, environmentally friendly
- Replacement cost $50-80/lb
- **Preferred:** Look for R-410A sticker

**Visual Clues:**
- Sticker on unit side panel (if legible)
- R-22 units typically older design
- Post-2010 units almost always R-410A

### Dual-Zone vs Single-Zone

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Dual-zone:** Two exterior units OR single large unit (5+ ton)
- **Single-zone:** One smaller unit (3-4 ton)

**Arizona Context:**
- Dual-zone **strongly preferred** for 2-story homes
- Single-zone struggles with upstairs cooling
- Budget impact: Dual adds $3-5k to replacement cost

### Visual Scoring Rubric (1-10 Scale)

| Score | Condition | Age Range | Action | Budget |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 9-10 | Excellent | 0-3 years | None | $0 |
| 7-8 | Good | 4-7 years | Monitor | $500 annual maintenance |
| 5-6 | Fair | 8-12 years | Plan replacement 2-3 years | $5-8k soon |
| 3-4 | Poor | 13-15 years | Replace within 1 year | $6-10k urgent |
| 1-2 | Critical | 16+ years | Immediate replacement | $6-12k immediate |

**HVAC Replacement Costs (Arizona):**
- Single-zone (3-4 ton): $5,000-8,000
- Dual-zone (2x units): $10,000-15,000
- Emergency replacement: Add 30%

### Photo Analysis Priority

**Primary:**
1. **Side/rear exterior** - HVAC unit(s) visible
2. **Close-up of unit** - Brand, model, condition

**Secondary:**
3. **Multiple angles** - Check for dual-zone configuration
4. **Shade structures** - Awning or covering

**Fallback:**
- If no HVAC photos, estimate from home age (assume installed at build)
- Note "unable to assess, assume typical 12-year Arizona lifespan"

## 4. Foundation/Stucco Assessment

### Red Flags to Note

**CRITICAL (Structural Concern):**
- **Diagonal cracks** > 1/4" wide (settlement/foundation movement)
- **Stair-step cracks** in block walls (foundation shifting)
- **Horizontal cracks** at window/door corners (settlement)
- **Vertical cracks** at corners (severe settlement)
- **Spalling** (concrete surface breaking off)
- **Visible rebar** exposed through stucco
- **Tilting/leaning** walls or chimneys
- **Gaps** between stucco and foundation

**MODERATE (Monitor/Repair):**
- **Hairline cracks** < 1/8" (common, cosmetic)
- **Vertical cracks** at control joints (normal expansion)
- **Minor spalling** at ground level (water damage)
- **Discoloration** streaks (water intrusion)
- **Efflorescence** (white mineral deposits)
- **Soft stucco** areas (moisture damage)

**MINOR (Cosmetic):**
- **Surface crazing** (fine spider web cracks)
- **Paint peeling** or fading
- **Minor chips** or dings
- **Color inconsistency** (repairs/additions)

### Arizona-Specific Foundation Issues

**Desert Soil Movement:**
- Clay soil expands/contracts with moisture
- Summer heat causes soil shrinkage
- Monsoon rain causes soil expansion
- **Result:** Common foundation movement, cracks

**Stucco Cracking Patterns:**
- **Vertical cracks** at windows/doors = normal expansion/contraction
- **Horizontal cracks** = potential settlement concern
- **Diagonal cracks** from corners = foundation movement

**Age Expectations:**
- Homes < 5 years: Should show minimal cracking
- Homes 10-20 years: Some hairline cracks normal
- Homes 30+ years: Multiple repairs expected

### Stucco Condition Categories

## Integration with Property Analysis Pipeline

### Phase 2: Image Assessment

The exterior assessment skill is invoked during Phase 2 (Image Assessment) of the multi-agent analysis pipeline:

1. **Image-Assessor Agent** calls this skill
2. **Analyzes downloaded property photos** from `data/property_images/{property_hash}/`
3. **Generates exterior assessment JSON**
4. **Merges with enrichment_data.json** under `exterior_assessment` field

### Usage in Deal Sheets

Exterior assessment data populates deal sheet sections:

- **Section B (Systems):** Roof score, pool equipment condition
- **Section B (Cost Efficiency):** HVAC replacement timeline
- **Section B (Backyard):** Utility score, covered patio value
- **Budget Impact Summary:** Near-term and long-term capital expenses

### Cross-Skill Dependencies

- **arizona-context-lite**: Provides era calibration and age estimation guidelines
- **image-assessment**: Coordinates interior and exterior photo analysis
- **scoring**: Translates exterior condition to Section B scores

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always analyze multiple photos** for each category when available
2. **Apply Arizona-specific aging factors** to all lifespan estimates
3. **Note photo limitations** explicitly in confidence ratings
4. **Provide budget ranges** for all identified issues
5. **Distinguish critical vs cosmetic** issues clearly
6. **Cross-reference home age** to validate equipment age estimates
7. **Use conservative estimates** when photo quality is poor
8. **Document evidence** for all condition assessments

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-relying on single photo** - Always seek multiple angles
2. **Ignoring Arizona heat factor** - Apply degradation multipliers
3. **Missing HVAC refrigerant type** - R-22 is expensive to service
4. **Underestimating pool equipment age** - Components age at different rates
5. **Confusing cosmetic cracks with structural** - Know Arizona crack patterns
6. **Overlooking backyard orientation** - Critical for Arizona usability
7. **Skipping confidence ratings** - Always note assessment limitations
