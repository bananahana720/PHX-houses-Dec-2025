## 1. Roof Visual Condition Protocol

### Arizona Tile Roof Age Indicators

| Age | Visual Indicators | Score |
|-----|-------------------|-------|
| 0-5 yrs (New) | Uniform color, sharp edges, clean valleys, no underlayment visible | 9-10 |
| 6-15 yrs (Good) | Slight color variation, minor UV fade, edges intact | 7-8 |
| 16-25 yrs (Fair) | Noticeable fading, worn edges, 1-2 cracked tiles, debris in valleys | 5-6 |
| 26+ yrs (Poor) | Significant fading, multiple cracks/missing tiles, sagging, underlayment exposed | 1-4 |

### Shingle Roof Age Indicators

| Age | Visual Indicators | Score |
|-----|-------------------|-------|
| 0-8 yrs (New) | Uniform granules, no curling, straight lines | 9-10 |
| 9-15 yrs (Good) | Minimal granule loss, slight edge curling | 7-8 |
| 16-20 yrs (Fair) | Noticeable granule loss, curling/cupping | 5-6 |
| 21+ yrs (Poor) | Significant granule loss, widespread curling, exposed underlayment | 1-4 |

### Arizona-Specific Adjustments

- **UV degradation**: Apply -2 years effective life for south/west-facing slopes
- **Expected lifespans**: Shingle 15-20 yrs (national: 20-25), Tile 30-40 yrs (national: 50+)
- **Monsoon impact**: Check valleys for debris, displaced tiles after storms

### Budget Impact

| Score | Action | Budget |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 9-10 | None | $0 |
| 7-8 | Monitor | $0-5k in 5+ years |
| 5-6 | Plan 3-5 years | $8-15k |
| 3-4 | Replace 1-2 years | $10-20k |
| 1-2 | Immediate | $10-25k+ |

**Costs**: Shingle $5-8/sqft, Tile $8-12/sqft, Emergency +20-30%

## 2. Pool Equipment Age Protocol

### Visual Age Estimation Matrix

| Age | Visual Indicators | Equipment Condition |
|-----|-------------------|---------------------|
| 0-3 yrs (New) | Crisp labels, no rust, bright PVC, digital controls | Excellent |
| 4-7 yrs (Good) | UV-faded labels, minor surface rust, faded PVC | Good |
| 8-12 yrs (Fair) | Faded/illegible labels, moderate rust, sun-bleached PVC, calcium buildup | Fair |
| 13+ yrs (Poor) | Missing labels, heavy rust/pitting, brittle PVC, obsolete brands | Poor |

### Brand/Age Clues

- Variable speed pumps = post-2010 (energy regulations)
- Digital controls = post-2005
- Mechanical time clocks = pre-2000s
- Large metal motors = pre-2000s

### Arizona Degradation Factor

Apply **+20% aging** to all pool equipment (Phoenix heat 110-120F accelerates aging):
- Pump motors: 10yr rated = 8-9yr actual
- Filter tanks: 15yr rated = 12-13yr actual
- PVC brittleness: 7-10 years before issues

### Budget by Age

| Component | 0-5 yrs | 6-10 yrs | 11-15 yrs | 16+ yrs |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Pump | $0 | $500 reserve | $1,200 replace | $1,500 urgent |
| Filter | $0 | $300 reserve | $800 replace | $1,000 urgent |
| Heater | $0 | $1,000 reserve | $2,500 replace | $3,000+ urgent |
| Salt Cell | $0 | $400 reserve | $800 replace | $1,000 urgent |

**Complete replacement**: $5,000-8,000

## 3. HVAC Exterior Unit Protocol

### Visual Age Estimation

| Age | Visual Indicators | Score |
|-----|-------------------|-------|
| 0-5 yrs (New) | Modern cabinet, pristine paint, clean coils, curved fan blades | 9-10 |
| 6-10 yrs (Good) | Slight top fading, minor edge wear, sticker UV fade | 7-8 |
| 11-15 yrs (Fair) | Paint oxidation, rust spots, dust on coils, older design | 5-6 |
| 16+ yrs (Poor) | Significant rust, heavy coil contamination, missing panels | 1-4 |

### Arizona Heat Degradation

- **National lifespan**: 15-20 years
- **Arizona lifespan**: 10-15 years (-5 years effective)
- **Accelerators**: South/west sun exposure, no shade, dust, continuous runtime

### Refrigerant Types

| Type | Era | Cost | Recommendation |
|------|-----|------|----------------|
| R-22 | Pre-2010 | $150-200/lb (recycled only) | Replacement recommended |
| R-410A | Post-2010 | $50-80/lb | Preferred |

### Budget Impact

| Score | Age | Action | Budget |
|-------|-----|--------|--------|
| 9-10 | 0-3 yrs | None | $0 |
| 7-8 | 4-7 yrs | Monitor | $500/yr maintenance |
| 5-6 | 8-12 yrs | Plan 2-3 years | $5-8k |
| 3-4 | 13-15 yrs | Replace <1 year | $6-10k |
| 1-2 | 16+ yrs | Immediate | $6-12k |

**Costs**: Single-zone $5-8k, Dual-zone $10-15k, Emergency +30%

## 4. Foundation/Stucco Assessment

### Crack Classification

| Severity | Indicators | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Critical | Diagonal >1/4", stair-step in block, horizontal at corners, exposed rebar, tilting | Professional inspection required |
| Moderate | Hairline <1/8", vertical at control joints, minor spalling, efflorescence | Monitor/repair |
| Minor | Surface crazing, paint peeling, minor chips, color inconsistency | Cosmetic only |

### Arizona Soil Context

- Clay soil expands/contracts seasonally (monsoon expansion, summer shrinkage)
- Vertical cracks at windows/doors = normal expansion
- Horizontal cracks = settlement concern
- Diagonal from corners = foundation movement

### Condition Scoring

| Score | Condition | Issues |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 9-10 | Excellent | No cracks, uniform, well-maintained |
| 7-8 | Good | Minor hairline cracks only |
| 5-6 | Fair | Multiple hairline, some 1/8-1/4", water stains |
| 1-4 | Poor | Large cracks >1/4", spalling, structural concerns |

## 5. Backyard Utility Assessment

### Covered Patio Scoring

| Score | Coverage | Quality | Amenities |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 9-10 | 10-15+ ft | Wood beam/tile roof | Fan + lighting |
| 7-8 | 8-10 ft | Metal awning/ramada | Fan or light |
| 5-6 | 6-8 ft | Aluminum awning | None |
| 1-4 | None/damaged | Unusable | N/A |

**Arizona context**: Covered patio essential for May-September usability

### Pool-to-Yard Ratio

| Pool % | Layout | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| <40% | Optimal - ample usable space | 9-10 |
| 40-60% | Functional - some usable space | 7-8 |
| 60-80% | Pool-dominated - minimal space | 5-6 |
| >80% | Oversized - maintenance access only | 1-4 |
| No pool | Full flexibility | 8 |

### Grass/Hardscape Ratio (Arizona Ideal)

| Ratio | Score | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 20-40% grass, 40-60% hardscape | 9-10 | Water efficient, moderate maintenance |
| 40-60% grass | 7-8 | High water/maintenance |
| >60% grass | 5-6 | Excessive for Arizona |
| 100% hardscape | 6-7 | Low maintenance but hot |

### Yard Orientation

| Facing | Sun Pattern | Score |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| North | Morning sun, afternoon shade | 10 |
| East | Morning sun, moderate afternoon | 8 |
| South | Full sun, hot afternoons | 6 |
| West | Afternoon sun, extreme heat | 4 |

## 6. Photo Selection Priority

**Primary (Must Analyze):**
1. Aerial/Drone - roof, layout, orientation
2. Front Exterior - roof, foundation, curb appeal
3. Rear Exterior - backyard, patio, pool ratio, HVAC
4. Pool Equipment Pad - all components, age indicators

**Secondary:**
5. Side Exteriors - HVAC close-up, roof profile
6. Pool Close-Up - water/tile condition
7. Patio Detail - structure, amenities

**Fallbacks:**
- No aerial: Use front + rear, note "limited visibility"
- No equipment photos: Budget $3k inspection reserve
- No HVAC photos: Assume 12-year AZ lifespan from build year

## Best Practices

1. Analyze multiple photos per category when available
2. Apply Arizona aging factors to all lifespan estimates
3. Note photo limitations in confidence ratings
4. Provide budget ranges for identified issues
5. Distinguish critical vs cosmetic issues
6. Cross-reference home age to validate equipment estimates
7. Use conservative estimates for poor photo quality

## Common Pitfalls

1. Over-relying on single photo
2. Ignoring Arizona heat factor
3. Missing R-22 refrigerant (expensive to service)
4. Underestimating pool equipment age
5. Confusing cosmetic vs structural cracks
6. Overlooking backyard orientation
7. Skipping confidence ratings
