# Exterior Assessment Detailed Protocols

This reference file contains detailed assessment protocols for exterior property features.

## 1. Roof Visual Condition Protocol

### Arizona Tile Roof Age Indicators

| Age | Visual Indicators | Score |
|-----|-------------------|-------|
| 0-5 yrs (New) | Uniform color, sharp edges, clean valleys, no underlayment visible | 9-10 |
| 6-15 yrs (Good) | Slight color variation, minor UV fade, edges intact | 7-8 |
| 16-25 yrs (Fair) | Noticeable fading, worn edges, 1-2 cracked tiles, debris in valleys | 5-6 |
| 26+ yrs (Poor) | Significant fading, multiple cracks/missing tiles, sagging, underlayment exposed | 1-4 |

### Shingle Roof Age Indicators

| Age | Visual Indicators | Score |
|-----|-------------------|-------|
| 0-8 yrs (New) | Uniform granules, no curling, straight lines | 9-10 |
| 9-15 yrs (Good) | Minimal granule loss, slight edge curling | 7-8 |
| 16-20 yrs (Fair) | Noticeable granule loss, curling/cupping | 5-6 |
| 21+ yrs (Poor) | Significant granule loss, widespread curling, exposed underlayment | 1-4 |

### Arizona-Specific Adjustments

- **UV degradation**: Apply -2 years effective life for south/west-facing slopes
- **Expected lifespans**: Shingle 15-20 yrs (national: 20-25), Tile 30-40 yrs (national: 50+)
- **Monsoon impact**: Check valleys for debris, displaced tiles after storms

### Budget Impact

| Score | Action | Budget |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 9-10 | None | $0 |
| 7-8 | Monitor | $0-5k in 5+ years |
| 5-6 | Plan 3-5 years | $8-15k |
| 3-4 | Replace 1-2 years | $10-20k |
| 1-2 | Immediate | $10-25k+ |

**Costs**: Shingle $5-8/sqft, Tile $8-12/sqft, Emergency +20-30%

## 2. Pool Equipment Age Protocol

### Visual Age Estimation Matrix

| Age | Visual Indicators | Equipment Condition |
|-----|-------------------|---------------------|
| 0-3 yrs (New) | Crisp labels, no rust, bright PVC, digital controls | Excellent |
| 4-7 yrs (Good) | UV-faded labels, minor surface rust, faded PVC | Good |
| 8-12 yrs (Fair) | Faded/illegible labels, moderate rust, sun-bleached PVC, calcium buildup | Fair |
| 13+ yrs (Poor) | Missing labels, heavy rust/pitting, brittle PVC, obsolete brands | Poor |

### Brand/Age Clues

- Variable speed pumps = post-2010 (energy regulations)
- Digital controls = post-2005
- Mechanical time clocks = pre-2000s
- Large metal motors = pre-2000s

### Arizona Degradation Factor

Apply **+20% aging** to all pool equipment (Phoenix heat 110-120F accelerates aging):
- Pump motors: 10yr rated = 8-9yr actual
- Filter tanks: 15yr rated = 12-13yr actual
- PVC brittleness: 7-10 years before issues

### Budget by Age

| Component | 0-5 yrs | 6-10 yrs | 11-15 yrs | 16+ yrs |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Pump | $0 | $500 reserve | $1,200 replace | $1,500 urgent |
| Filter | $0 | $300 reserve | $800 replace | $1,000 urgent |
| Heater | $0 | $1,000 reserve | $2,500 replace | $3,000+ urgent |
| Salt Cell | $0 | $400 reserve | $800 replace | $1,000 urgent |

**Complete replacement**: $5,000-8,000

## 3. HVAC Exterior Unit Protocol

### Visual Age Estimation

| Age | Visual Indicators | Score |
|-----|-------------------|-------|
| 0-5 yrs (New) | Modern cabinet, pristine paint, clean coils, curved fan blades | 9-10 |
| 6-10 yrs (Good) | Slight top fading, minor edge wear, sticker UV fade | 7-8 |
| 11-15 yrs (Fair) | Paint oxidation, rust spots, dust on coils, older design | 5-6 |
| 16+ yrs (Poor) | Significant rust, heavy coil contamination, missing panels | 1-4 |

### Arizona Heat Degradation

- **National lifespan**: 15-20 years
- **Arizona lifespan**: 10-15 years (-5 years effective)
- **Accelerators**: South/west sun exposure, no shade, dust, continuous runtime

### Refrigerant Types

| Type | Era | Cost | Recommendation |
|------|-----|------|----------------|
| R-22 | Pre-2010 | $150-200/lb (recycled only) | Replacement recommended |
| R-410A | Post-2010 | $50-80/lb | Preferred |

### Budget Impact

| Score | Age | Action | Budget |
|-------|-----|--------|--------|
| 9-10 | 0-3 yrs | None | $0 |
| 7-8 | 4-7 yrs | Monitor | $500/yr maintenance |
| 5-6 | 8-12 yrs | Plan 2-3 years | $5-8k |
| 3-4 | 13-15 yrs | Replace <1 year | $6-10k |
| 1-2 | 16+ yrs | Immediate | $6-12k |

**Costs**: Single-zone $5-8k, Dual-zone $10-15k, Emergency +30%

## 4. Foundation/Stucco Assessment

### Crack Classification

| Severity | Indicators | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Critical | Diagonal >1/4", stair-step in block, horizontal at corners, exposed rebar, tilting | Professional inspection required |
| Moderate | Hairline <1/8", vertical at control joints, minor spalling, efflorescence | Monitor/repair |
| Minor | Surface crazing, paint peeling, minor chips, color inconsistency | Cosmetic only |

### Arizona Soil Context

- Clay soil expands/contracts seasonally (monsoon expansion, summer shrinkage)
- Vertical cracks at windows/doors = normal expansion
- Horizontal cracks = settlement concern
- Diagonal from corners = foundation movement

### Condition Scoring

| Score | Condition | Issues |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 9-10 | Excellent | No cracks, uniform, well-maintained |
| 7-8 | Good | Minor hairline cracks only |
| 5-6 | Fair | Multiple hairline, some 1/8-1/4", water stains |
| 1-4 | Poor | Large cracks >1/4", spalling, structural concerns |

|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 9-10 | 10-15+ ft | Wood beam/tile roof | Fan + lighting |
| 7-8 | 8-10 ft | Metal awning/ramada | Fan or light |
| 5-6 | 6-8 ft | Aluminum awning | None |
| 1-4 | None/damaged | Unusable | N/A |

**Arizona context**: Covered patio essential for May-September usability

### Pool-to-Yard Ratio

| Pool % | Layout | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| <40% | Optimal - ample usable space | 9-10 |
| 40-60% | Functional - some usable space | 7-8 |
| 60-80% | Pool-dominated - minimal space | 5-6 |
| >80% | Oversized - maintenance access only | 1-4 |
| No pool | Full flexibility | 8 |

### Grass/Hardscape Ratio (Arizona Ideal)

| Ratio | Score | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 20-40% grass, 40-60% hardscape | 9-10 | Water efficient, moderate maintenance |
| 40-60% grass | 7-8 | High water/maintenance |
| >60% grass | 5-6 | Excessive for Arizona |
| 100% hardscape | 6-7 | Low maintenance but hot |

### Yard Orientation

| Facing | Sun Pattern | Score |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| North | Morning sun, afternoon shade | 10 |
| East | Morning sun, moderate afternoon | 8 |
| South | Full sun, hot afternoons | 6 |
| West | Afternoon sun, extreme heat | 4 |

## 6. Photo Selection Priority

**Primary (Must Analyze):**
1. Aerial/Drone - roof, layout, orientation
2. Front Exterior - roof, foundation, curb appeal
3. Rear Exterior - backyard, patio, pool ratio, HVAC
4. Pool Equipment Pad - all components, age indicators

**Secondary:**
5. Side Exteriors - HVAC close-up, roof profile
6. Pool Close-Up - water/tile condition
7. Patio Detail - structure, amenities

**Fallbacks:**
- No aerial: Use front + rear, note "limited visibility"
- No equipment photos: Budget $3k inspection reserve
- No HVAC photos: Assume 12-year AZ lifespan from build year
