All Section C scores assigned as defaults (5.0) except natural_light (6.0 based on entryway transom windows) and fireplace (0.0 - none visible). Total interior score 88/190 is unreliable. Built 1997, so era baseline would be late 90s standards. CRITICAL: In-person showing or additional interior photos required before making purchase decision. Current scoring should NOT be used for tier classification."
