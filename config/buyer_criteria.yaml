# Buyer Criteria Configuration
# Kill-switch thresholds for property filtering
#
# This file defines the buyer's hard requirements for filtering properties
# in the PHX Home Analysis pipeline.
#
# All 8 criteria are HARD (instant fail). No SOFT criteria or severity accumulation.

# =============================================================================
# HARD CRITERIA (Instant Fail)
# =============================================================================
# Any failure in hard criteria immediately rejects the property

hard_criteria:
  hoa_fee: 0              # Must be zero (no HOA allowed)
  min_beds: 4             # Minimum 4 bedrooms required
  min_baths: 2            # Minimum 2 bathrooms required
  min_sqft: 1800          # Minimum 1800 sqft living space required
  min_lot_sqft: 8000      # Minimum 8000 sqft lot required (no maximum)
  sewer_type: "city"      # City sewer required (no septic)
  min_garage: 1           # Minimum 1 indoor garage space required
  solar_lease: false      # No solar leases allowed (liability)

# NOTES
# =============================================================================
# All criteria are HARD (instant fail). No SOFT criteria with severity accumulation.
# Properties must pass ALL hard criteria to proceed to scoring phase.
#
# Kill switch behavior:
# - Any single failure -> FAIL (instant rejection)
# - All pass -> PASS (proceed to scoring)
#
# Changes from previous configuration:
# - Sewer: Changed from SOFT (severity 2.5) to HARD
# - Garage: Changed from SOFT (severity 1.5, min 2) to HARD (min 1 indoor)
# - Lot size: Changed from SOFT range (7k-15k) to HARD minimum (>8k, no max)
# - Sqft: Added as new HARD criterion (>1800)
# - Year built: Removed from defaults (NoNewBuildKillSwitch still available)
